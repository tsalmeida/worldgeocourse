    <h1>World Geography Course</h1>
    <h2>Tiago Silva Almeida</h2>
</div>


<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Before I started writing this course, I thought I knew enough about the planet. Enough to talk to people and say interesting things, enough to act smart. I guess as I grew older, got married and had kids, these things lost their importance and suddenly I didn't believe I knew enough anymore.</p>

<p>My goal was then to learn the important stuff, things that you only learn if you seek them, or if you spend your life traveling the world. Traveling everywhere is expensive, troublesome, and in general not practical for most people.</p>

<p>Though I am a Geography graduate, I have many times considered that option to have been a mistake. Since my first day in College, when I first regretted it, I have had a few occasions to change my mind, this course being the most recent. My bad impression of the science, however, is also a big part of why I'm doing this at all. I learned almost none of this in College. When I looked online for something like this, I found nothing acceptable, and it doesn't surprise me, I wouldn't expect much from geographers.  I believe people want to know more about the planet, and geographers are doing a bad job at helping them.</p>

<p>I understand the Geography we will engage here as part of a Liberal Arts Education, that is, education worthy of and necessary for every free person. Every free man should know these things, so here we are to learn them.</p>

<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>You can click on most images to enlarge them without leaving the website and the same goes for youtube videos. External links, when clicked, will open on a new tab.</p>

<p>You will navigate through the courses by clicking on the vertical bars on either side of the central section. They are not viewable at this moment because there are no previous or next pages to the Introduction.</p>

<h1>Something else</h1>

<p>I designed this website using HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript (jQuery). I hope to keep it going for many years, no matter how successful it may be.</p>

<p>At the moment it doesn't cost me much to maintain, so I have no interest in any sort of payment, nor in using ads of any kind. This might change in the future if it becomes popular and the bandwidth costs go up. I don't like ads and will resort to donations if possible.</p>

<p>You will find our forum on the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldgeographycourse">/r/WorldGeographyCourse</a> subreddit.</p>

    <h1>1. Up to the Cenozoic Era</h1>

    <p>First of all, the Geologic Time Scale is thus divided: Eon > Era > Period > Epoch > Age > Chron.</p>

    <h2>The Precambrian Supereon</h2>

    <p>The Precambrian “supereon” encompasses three eons: the Hadean, the Archean and the Proterozoic. As a result, it spams 88% of Earth's age, from its creation (4.6 billion years ago) to the explosion of life that took place in the Cambrian period (500 million years ago). The Cambrian Period is part of the Paleozoic Era and of the Phanerozoic Eon.</p>

    <p>In the Precambrian, the Earth’s magnetic poles drifted around the planet, causing glaciations even in areas that today are near the Equator. Also during the Precambrian early single-cell organisms generated the oxygen in our atmosphere. This oxygen not only fuels most of life on Earth, but also broke down creating ozone, which protects the planet from the Sun’s ultraviolet rays.</p>

    <h2>The Phanerozoic Eon</h2>

    <p>Why is the Cambrian period so important that geologists named everything before "Precambrian"? Because that is when the “Cambrian explosion” happened, an explosion of life on the planet. Before the Cambrian era, almost all life on Earth were micro-organisms that did not leave proper fossils. The first fossils found comes from the Cambrian period.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The same Eon that covers the Cambrian Period also covers the time of the dinosaurs and continues today. This is the geologic eon we live in: the Phanerozoic Eon, which has lasted for about 500 million years.</p>

    <h3>The Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction Event</h3>

    <p>The dinosaurs lived in the Cretaceous Period. This period ends with the “Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event”, 66 million years ago, giving rise to the Paleogene Period. That event caused the extinction of three of every four species of plants and animals in the planet. Its cause was the impact of a meteor in the Yucatán Peninsula, in today’s Mexico, near the Caribbean, where it left a large crater. The impact was so great that the oxygen in the atmosphere caught fire for a brief time, incinerating the surface of the planet. Giant firestorms, which lasted longer, where also created and caused further destruction. The picture below, taken in Canada, shows a natural record of this.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The impact also caused longer-lasting climate change ("impact winter"), a rise of the sea level and mega tsunamis. The raw power of the impact is similar to a billion times that of the atomic bombs used in World War II.</p>

    <p>Only small animals that burrow underground or hide in caves, such as mammals, were able to survive. This allowed them to dominate life on the Planet for the next millions of year, including today. Mammal species grew 10% larger in size in the following millions of years.</p>

    <h3>The Cenozoic Era</h3>

    <p>We live in the Cenozoic Era, nicknamed “The Age of Mammals”, which started 66 million years ago.</p>

    <div class="around">

        <p><i><span class="centerText">An example of life in the early Cenozoic Era. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>During the Cenozoic Era, the continents assume the shape we currently know. Then happens the creation of the Isthmus of Panama, one of the most important geological events in the history of the planet. Connecting North and South America, it is today occupied by the country of Panama, home to the Panama Canal. Its effect of cutting-off the connection between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans had great effect in the climate of the planet. We will study its importance in a future chapter.</p>

    <h1>2. <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em> and their original habitat</h1>

    <p>The evolutionary history of humans starts 7 million years ago. First we have the sahelanthropus, for 3 million years, then the australopithecus, for another 2 million years. Both lived in Africa and are not considered humans. The “Anatomically Modern Human”, or <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em>, first appears around 200,000 years ago. The second “sapiens” differentiates modern humans from the <em>Homo sapiens idaltu</em>. This does not include neanderthals, which were either <em>Homo sapiens neanderthals</em> or <em>Homo neanderthals</em>, if a different species. The <em>Homo</em> genus had yet more species, all now extinct, and the neanderthals became extinct 40,000 years ago.</p>

    <p>Humans could not have evolved from the monkey, since they are both modern species. The species we did evolve from, however, looked like this:</p>

    </div>

    <p>For the last million years, we have the actual human species, but the level of conscience and social organization we enjoy today is more recent. Anthropologists have named it “Behavioral modernity”, and believe it to have started around 50,000 years ago. By that time, humans had already spread to Europe.</p>

    <p>All those <em>Homo sapiens</em> lived as nomadic hunter-gatherers all over the world. Their diet consisted mostly of scavenged vegetables—fruits, berries, nuts—and meat from hunting. It was a difficult and dangerous life, as people still did not have dominion over nature. The most important advancement from then on was the complexity of their brain. It allowed them to outperform every other predator and every other subspecies of human evolution. This upgrade came not from further evolution, but by the accumulation of experience and knowledge. With the development of Agriculture, societies became more complex and thus more powerful. Man becomes the wolf of man.</p>

    <p>At around 11,000 b.C, at the end of the last Ice Age, humans start to live in villages. Within a few thousand years, plant and animal domestication begins. As seen on the map above, by then humans had reached the Americas. They were still to reach Madagascar and New Zealand—the large islands next to Africa and Australia, respectively.</p>

    <p>Africa has so many large mammals today because they evolved together with humans, learning to fear them. By contrast, both in the Americas and in Australia, the arrival of humans meant the doom of native large mammals. For example, Australia had giant kangaroos and the Americas had giant ground sloths and mammoths.<p>

    <p>Wherever humans reached, they spread and multiplied fast. In a thousand years they populated the Americas.<p>

    <h2>Their original habitat: Sub-Saharan Africa</h2>

    <p>The map below shows the different vegetation ecosystems found in Africa. Not only the original species of the genus <em>Homo</em>, but also successive generations of further evolved humans evolved in Sub-Saharan Africa (the Sahara Desert being the large pale region in North Africa), later spreading around the planet.</p>

    <p>…but not really. Since the planet is round, there is a great amount of stretching needed to spread it out on a plane. Below is a <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> comic on the different ways to do just that, some with more distortion than others.</p>

    <h2>Geographical formations</h2>

    <p>Again I will appeal to <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a>’s synthetic power for a first view of the main geographical formations:</p>

    <p>Now lets go through those.</p>

    <h3>Mountains and volcanoes</h3>

    <p>A volcano is a type of a mountain, as in "large and tall landforms", but both result from tectonic plate movement. </p>

    <p>Tectonic plate movement is the most powerful force shaping the planet. Where tectonic plates clash, either one or both of them climb, expelling underground material. If the tectonic plates move away from each other, leaving the underground unexposed, the same happens. The volcano is the conduit of this exposure. One volcanic eruption may expel magma, volcanic ash, gases or combinations of them.</p>

    <p>Here's a photograph of an erupting volcano:</p>

    <p>Non-volcanic mountains are elevated masses of rock. Most are part of mountain chains, large elevated areas from clashing tectonic plates. We will review this process and the different types of mountains in more detail in a future chapter. Here's an example of a mountain in a mountain chain. Just know that's not the entire mountain chain, they are much larger, as in whole regions. We will also study mountain chains further ahead.</p>

    <h3>Hills</h3>

    <p>Under the lake on the comic, you will find a few hills. There is no universal height when a hill becomes a mountain. In practice, however, it is easy enough to spot the difference, because they are shorter and less steep. Hills may come from tectonic plate movement, but more often it's by accumulation from erosion. Rains, rivers, glaciers or wind can be the ultimate cause.</p>

    <h3>Mesas</h3>

    <p>There is one last elevated formation on the comic: mesas. The word means “table”, which is descriptive enough. They originate from erosion of the top part of hills and mountains.</p>

    <h3>Lakes</h3>

    <p>Now notice the lake on the right side of the volcano on the map. That might be coincidence, but it makes perfect sense. That might be a crater lake, created when volcanoes cause the ground around them to sink. Once the crater is set, a water source can fill it up with water. In the comic, there are two rivers streaming into the pictured lake. In a similar way, some volcanoes create a lake surrounding them, called “volcanic lakes”. There are many other ways for a lake to form, but the most common would be simple accumulation of water in a depressed area. The depression itself would result from the area around it rising. Below is a photograph of Moraine Lake, in Canada, where a landslide blocked the path of a river, causing it to accumulate. This sets it apart from most lakes of the region, which are the result of melting glaciers.</p>

    <h3>Glaciers</h3>

    <p>Speaking of glaciers, you can see one in the comic. They are accumulations of ice on top of mountains due to the cold weather on high altitudes. The cold weather is a result of less atmospheric pressure, which leads to less air, meaning less matter to gather heat from the Sun. Glaciers are massive and kept in constant movement due to the weight of ever accumulating snow. They partially melt in the warm months, giving rise to rivers that increase discharge in the summer.</p>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <h3>Rivers</h3>

    <p>We move on to rivers. There are two sources for free-flowing surface water: melting glaciers and water springs. Both are present in the comic. Water springs do not have a constant discharge, varying according to rainfall. The rainwater then flows through the ground and becomes trapped in cave systems. Some may dry up completely in the low-rainfall season. Hot water springs also exist, with water pumped from underground by volcanic activity. Below you will see an example of a water spring.</p>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <p>A drainage basin or catchment area is the area drained by a river. All humidity in that area flows into the river, be it originated from rainfall, tributary rivers or glaciers. In the comic, that would be the mountain range, as well as the area surrounding the tributary rivers and the main river itself. The forest area is not part of the drainage basin, as it seems to feed on rainfall from the Ocean humidity. This same humidity stops at the mountain range, giving origin to the desert. In the comic, two rivers flow into a lake, which then flows into the main river, which flows into the Ocean. This is also common.</p>

    <h3>Deltas and Estuaries</h3>

    <p>Upon reaching the ocean, a river might form a delta (as pictured on the xkcd comic) or an estuary. Though you will find those terms used without discretion as if interchangeable, there is a difference. Deltas are triagular shapes, as the river spreads on many smaller streams closer to the coast. They are fertile, because this river formation distributes its nutrient-rich sediment around. In estuaries, by contrast, rivers reach the ocean with more momentum. They drop straight into the ocean, affecting the landscape to a lesser degree.</p>

    <div class="around">

    <h3>Biomes</h3>

    <p>Biomes are areas with similar conditions of climate, fauna and flora. A more popularized name for biome would be “ecosystem”. The whole planet is an ecosystem, as in a balanced ecological system, but regions may have a separate balance of their own. The interdependence between different elements may be surprising. Some trees are essential to their whole ecosystem, meanwhile being dependent on certain animals. At the same time, all are dependent on the climate and on the water cycle. Inside a biome you may have another biome of relative isolation, such as an oasis in a desert, or on mountains. The world climate is in constant change, both from natural and from man-made causes. Biomes expand and contract according to these changes. In the xkcd comic you will find three biomes: forest, plains and desert. Here is a world map of biomes:</p>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <h3>Deserts</h3>

    <p>On the left side of the Mountain Range on the comic, you can see a desert. This also makes good sense, as mountain ranges can block humidity from passing through. Deserts are also caused by equatorial wind belts or by cold currents. The former are warms winds which do not drop humidity; this is the case of the Sahara Desert. The latter cause moist winds to rain before they reach land; this is the cause of the Atacama Desert, pictured below.</p>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <h3>Plains</h3>

    <p>Next, we have plains near the mountain range and on the left side of the mesa in the comic. Plains are flat areas located between elevated areas. In the case of the comic, between the hills and the mountain range, as well as between the volcano and the mesa. When a river runs through a plain, such as we see in the comic, they become river valleys. River valleys are important for agriculture because rivers provide water for irrigation and the flat lands are optimal for farming.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Forests</h3>

    <p>Finally, there’s a forest on the coast, on the right side of the mesa. It’s difficult to define a forest, but in general they are land covered with trees and other woody vegetation. Depending on climate, there are  different kinds of forests - as well as deserts and plains. We will study those in a future chapter. More heat and humidity means the forest can become dense, such as the Amazon Rainforest. In temperate regions, which are colder, less humid and subject to the four seasons, forests are more sparse.</p>

    <h3>Continents and Oceans</h3>

    <p>Continents are large areas of land, while oceans are large areas of water. We tend to picture both as much more far apart than they are in reality. The following two pictures should help disperse that impression:</p>

    <div class="around">

    <h3>Islands</h3>

    <p>Islands are areas of land surrounded by water by all sides which are, at the same time, smaller than continents. For example, Australia is a continent, so it would not qualify as an island. A collection of islands somewhat near each other is an archipelago. An island may be inside or bordering a lake, surrounded by a river, an ocean, or combinations thereof. Marajó Island, in Northern Brazil, for example, is the largest island surrounded by both the Ocean and a river. Brazil also has the largest river island, Bananal Island.</p>

    <h3>Seas</h3>

    <p>Seas are large bodies of salt water, surrounded in part or completely by land. Thus, a lake is in general called a sea if it consists of salt water. We will review the most important seas in a later chapter. For now, here’s a map of the seven seas as understood in Medieval Europe (the meaning has changed over time).</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Bays</h3>

    <p>Bays are subdivisions of the ocean surrounded from three sides by land, but in a smaller scale than seas. They are important because the surrounding land may block waves and wind, which can make them good areas for ports and fishing. Many coastal cities started on a bay or have nearby bays. A gulf is a larger bay. Here’s a bay:</p>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <h3>Peninsulas</h3>

    <p>Peninsulas are the reverse of bays: areas of land surrounded by water on three sides, connected to a larger mainland. On the following image you’ll see an example of both a Peninsula and a Gulf (again, larger bays).</p>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <h3>Lagoons</h3>

    <p>Lagoons are similar to bays in that they are bodies of water surrounded by land on three sides. The difference is that their opening into the larger body of water is either small or further blocked by an island or reef. Here’s an example:</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/GlenrockLagoonFromLeichhardtLookout.JPG" title="Glenrock Lagoon, Australia.

    </div>

    <h3>Atolls</h3>

    <p>By the way, an atoll is a ring-shaped coral reef, which thus surrounds a lagoon, such as:</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Atafutrim.jpg" title="Atafu Atoll. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Atafutrim.jpg/800px-Atafutrim.jpg" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Atafu Atoll. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <h3>Straits</h3>

    <p>We’re down to the last two: straits and ishtmuses. Straits are narrow openings of land from one larger body of water to another, thus in general forming a navigable path. Some straits have been important in history as strategical chokehold points: you control the strait, you control who can pass through it. Here’s one example:</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/STS059-238-074_Strait_of_Gibraltar.jpg" title="The Strait of Gibraltar, between the Iberic Peninsula, in Europe, and the North of Africa.

    </div>

    <h3>Isthmuses</h3>

    <p>When you need a strait and can’t have one, the next best thing is an isthmus: a narrow patch of land between to large bodies of water. They are useful to transport cargo through land from one body of water to the other and they are prime spots for building a canal, which works as an artificial strait. One famous example is the Panama Canal, seen below, which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.</p>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <h3>That’s it</h3>

    <p>This is as far as we will go, but geographers, geologists, river engineers, captains and other students of navigation will know other formations. This is as far as we will need for this course, but I’ll give a quick example of what else there is out there.</p>

    <h1>4. The oceans</h1>

    <h2>The World Ocean</h2>

    <p>The oceans are subdivisions of the huge mass of salty water, the "World Ocean", that makes up for 71% of Earth’s surface area. This cool animation from Wikipedia shows it well (just remember the blank areas are the continents):</p>

    <h2>The Artic Ocean</h2>

    <p>The Arctic Ocean sits on the North Pole and is the smallest and shallowest of the oceans. Ice covers parts of the Arctic Ocean for most of the year and in the winter, almost completely.</p>

    <h2>The Pacific Ocean</h2>

    <p>The Pacific Ocean is the largest, covering 46% of Earth’s surface. Here’s a map:</p>

    </div>

    <p>The Pacific was the first ocean explored by Europeans, in the 16th century. The main European sea powers of the time were Spain and Portugal, the latter having named it, "pacific" meaning "peaceful" in Portuguese. There are many islands in the Pacific. In the map below you see the archipelagos of Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia. Melanesia includes New Guinea, the largest island after Greenland—Australia is a continent, not an island.</p>

    <h2>The Atlantic Ocean</h2>

    <p>The Atlantic Ocean borders Europe and Africa to the East, America to the West. In the 16th century, European explorers were first able to cross it to reach the American continent. Europeans have called it Atlantic, after the Greek Mithology titan that holds the sky on his back, since the 5th century b.C.. It is sometimes called “the pond”, a small lake, due to the cultural proximity between the United States and Europe. The term “Black Atlantic” is a reference to the slave trade from Africa to America and the Caribbean.</p>

    <h2>The Indian Ocean</h2>

    <p>The Indian Ocean lays between the Atlantic and the Pacific. It borders Africa to the West, the Middle East and Asia to the North, and Australia to the East. 16th century European explorers names it not in reference to the country of India, but to the East Indies. East Indies was the European name for East Asia and South East Asia. The West Indies would then be the Caribbean, on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>

    <p>The Southern Ocean, surrounding Antarctica, is the hardest to navigate. A powerful cyclonic storm rages the Southern Ocean, from West to East around Antarctica.</p>

    <h1>5. The continents</h1>

    <p>There are different ways to divide the landmass of the world. The following Wikipedia animation explains it quite well:</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Continental_models-Australia.gif" title="Animated world map of the different ways to view continents.

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Animated world map of the different ways to view continents. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>From now on we will go with the division that results in seven continents. The Australia continent we will call Oceania—which I will explain later. That leaves us with: North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania and Antarctica. Just to keep in mind just how connected the continents are, take a moment to understand this map:</p>

    <h2>Europe</h2>

    <p>Let’s start with the supercontinent of Eurasia because it's the hardest to break down. We begin with the borders between Europe and Asia.</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Europe_Asia_transcontinental.png" title="Map of the Boundaries between Europe and Asia.

    </div>

    <p>Focus on the line dividing blue and light blue, which is the present boundary between Europe and Asia. Now let's brake it down into three. First, the one that cuts through Russia and Kazakhstan, from the Arctic Ocean to the Caspian Sea. Second, cutting through Georgia, Russia and Azerbaijan, from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea. Third, from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, straight through Turkey. All these are cultural borders but also have natural barriers that make good sense.</p>

    <p>The first boundary outlines the Ural Mountains, seen below:</p>

    <div class="around">

    <p>The second spans the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range, seen below:</p>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Caucasus Mountain Range (covered in snow). Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>The third is the easiest, right on the Bosphorus Strait, the narrowest strait used for navigation on the planet. Europe lays on the western side, Asia, on the eastern side.</p>

    <p>The other European limits are easier. It goes north from the Arctic Ocean to south, in the Mediterranean Sea. The Atlantic Ocean lays to the west. This also includes the Brittish Isles and Iceland, because of how near they are. Since culture is also a factor, the Mediterranean Islands belonging to European countries are also included.</p>

    <h2>Asia</h2>

    <p>Moving on to the remaining part of the Eurasian supercontinent, we have Asia, the largest and most populous (currently around 60% of the planet’s human population) continent:</p>

You will find maps of each of those (some including parts of neighboring continents) in the gallery below. Just be aware none of this is universally accepted and might never be. It's all just a learning and organization tool. For example, the first map, which follows the UN Statistics Division, does not correspond to all maps that follow.</p>

    <h2>Oceania</h2>

    <p>The animation in the beginning of this chapter calls this continent “Australia”. That's acceptable, but also confusing, due to the country of Australia. This division also does not include New Zealand, which would then be part of Zealandia, a currently submerged continent. This is even less practical. So “Oceania”, I believe, is better.</p>

    <p>Oceania includes Australia and nearby islands</p>

    <h3>Micronesia, Melaneasia and Polynesia</h3>

    <p>The archipelagos on the eastern part of Oceania can be further divided into three regions, according to ethnic and cultural differences, as seen below.</p>

    </div>

    <p>In the archipelagos north of Oceania, we find the countries of Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Because they have a distinct Asian culture and ethnography, they are normally considered part of Southeast Asia. In a strict physical geographical sense, however, they are closer to Oceania. With the addition of these islands, this alternate Oceania would look like this:</p>

    <h2>Antarctica</h2>

    <p>And for our last continent, we have Antarctica, in the South Pole. The reason why Antarctica is a continent, as opposed to the Arctic, is that it is a frozen mass of land. The Arctic, in the North Pole, is not a continent, but only the frozen Northern Ocean.</p>

    <p>Antartica is not populated, though it does have permanent scientific stations from many countries. Some of these countries claim parts of its territory, but there is no general agreement. However, Antarctica has a important role in the regulation of the climate, which we will study in a future chapter.</p>

    <h1>6. The main seas, straits, isthmuses, peninsulas and bays</h1>

    <p>Most seas are further divisions of the oceans, but the name is also used for large salt-water lakes.</p>

    <p>We might as well start with a quick map of the “seven seas” as they were understood in the Middle Ages.</p>

    <p>The following map of the Mediterranean also includes a few other seas in the region. Let’s go through them one by one.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The region depicted in the map above has so much history, you could read a thousand books about all the things that happened there. It shows parts of three continents, Europe, Africa and Asia (The Middle East). Three important peninsulas are present. The first is the Iberic Peninsula, in Western Europe, today occupied by Spain and Portugal. The second is the Italian Peninsula, occupied by Italy. Finally, there’s the Peloponnesian Peninsula. It's the mass of land in Southern Greece, just short of being an island, connected to the mainland by the Isthmus of Corinth. There you will find the Greek city of Sparta.</p>

    <p>The Strait of Gibraltar and the Strait of Dardanelles separate the Mediterranean from the Atlantic and the Sea of Marmara, respectivelly. The Strait of Bosphorus then separates the Sea of Marmara from the Black Sea.</p>

    <p>The power struggle for control of the Mediterranean and surrounding land shaped human history like no other. On the Eastern region of the Mediterranean you will find the Fertile Crescent. That’s where agriculture was first developed, and along with it the first human civilizations.</p>

    <p>The first civilizations started in Mesopotamia, the land seen to the East, between the rivers Euphrates and Tigris. To the West, you have the Nile River, where the ancient Egyptian Empire developed. We will study these rivers in future chapters. Below you will find four maps. The first depicts the colonies of Ancient Greece. The second, the Macedonian Empire, which unified Greece. The third, the Roman Republic, which conquered Macedonia. The fourth, the Roman Empire, which followed the Republic after the power struggle caused by the death of Julius Caesar.</p>

    <p>From the maps above it should be clear that the main strategic goal of these early civilizations was to gain control of the Mediterranean. Up to conquest by the Roman Empire, fierce tribes of barbarians occupied most of mainland Europe. South of the Mediterranean there’s the natural barrier of the Sahara Desert. To the West, the Atlantic Ocean would still be unnavigable for many centuries. The remaining direction for expansion for these early European civilization was Asia. But there Asian powers such as the Persian Empire were already established, spawning from Mesopotamia and nearby regions. Meanwhile, the three greatest powers in Greece struggled for influence: Sparta, Athens and Thebes. For centuries they were able to keep Persia off Europe—though betrayed by Thebes, which sided with Persia. Greece would finally conquer Persia under the leadership of Alexander the Great, a Macedonian. Macedonia, a northern peripheric Greek colony, had unified Greece under its rule in the 4th century b.C.</p>

    <p>Alexander the Great’s death led to disintegration of his Empire. The role was then took by the Romans, who never conquered as far into Asia as Alexander. However, they expanded occupation of Europe and North Africa.</p>

    <p>One of the reasons why Europe fell into the “Dark Ages” is that it lost its control over the Mediterranean, becoming unable to trade with Asia. Less trade means less wealth. Though Christianity couldn’t win back control of Asia for Europe, it did manage to spread through most of Europe. The standard of Civilization it carried had a strong Roman, Macedonian and Greek influence. This is the heritage that differentiates Europe and makes it a separate continent.</p>

    <p>Now looking back at the original map of the Mediterranean, we see many different “seas” and gulfs. They have historical importance of themselves, but are less useful for this study. Take a moment to notice three of them: the Levantine Seaa, the Aegean Sea and the Adriatic Sea.</p>

    <p>The Levantine Sea, East of the Mediterranean, takes its name from the Levant, where today we find Israel. The struggle for control of this region has also had major impact in history, with the added significance of the Holy Land.</p>

    <p>In the Aegean Sea we find the Aegean Islands, which includes the important Greek islands of Crete and Rhodes.</p>

    <h2>The Adriatic Sea</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <p><i><span class="centerText">The Adriatic Sea. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>The Adriatic Sea, with over 1,300 islands, is connected to the Mediterranean Sea by the Strait of Oranto and lays between Italy and the Balkans. The first settlements off the coast of the Adriatic Sea started around 6,000 b.C. Its colonization by the Greeks began in the 7th century b.C.</p>

    <h2>The Sea of Marmara, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov</h2>

    </div>

    <p>Crossing the Strait of Dardanelles we arrive at the Sea of Marmara, which today falls withing the borders of Turkey. From the Sea of Marmara, crossing the Strait of Bosphorus, we arrive at the Black Sea, which is itself connected to the Sea of Azov. East of the Black Sea we have the Caucasus region, one of the Asian regions mentioned in the previous chapter. The name of course comes from the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range, also a border between Europe and Asia.</p>

    <h2>The Red Sea</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <p><i><span class="centerText">The Red Sea. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>The Red Sea, a gulf of the Indian Ocean, lays between Africa and the Middle-East. The Isthmus of Suez separates it from the Mediterranean Sea, a barrier brought down in 1869, the opening year of the Suez Canal. Before that, people carried goods across by land, so the Red Sea has long been a link between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The idea of the canal itself goes back to two thousand years b.C.</p>

    <h2>The Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Caspianseamap.png" title="The Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Caspianseamap.png" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">The Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>The Caspian sea is the final destination of the water carried by the Volga river, the most important river of Russia. That means it is an “endorheic” drainage basin: unlike most others, it does not discharge into the ocean. How can the Caspian Sea receive the full discharge of the largest river in Europe, as well as 130 others? This is possible because it is so large that its rate of evaporation balances the water imput out. In fact, it is so large that, if considered a lake, it would be the largest in the world. To drive home how exceptional this is, remember that most other endorheic basins are deserts. Of the endorheic basins that do have rivers and lakes, the Volga/Caspian is the largest. However, thorugh man-made canals, today the Volga does connect to the Ocean.</p>

    <p>The Caspian stands in the border between Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Iran and Turkmenistan. The largest city on the Caspian is Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. To the East of the Caspian, lies the Caucasus Mountains; to the west, Central Asia. Rich in oil, it was home to the first offshore oil wells, as well as the first machine-drilled oil well. In the early 20th century, Baku was the center of the oil industry. All this oil production was later administered by the Soviet Union, which captured the territory in 1920.</p>

    <p>Nearby Aral Sea does not look today as it did on the map above. Once one of the largest lakes in the world, and also endorheic, it has since dried-up due to use of its rivers for irrigation. The map below shows the shrinking of the Aral Sea up to 2008, but contemporary satellite images shows it even smaller.</p>

    <h2>The Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman</h2>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">The Persian Gulf. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>The Persian Gulf connects to the Gulf of Oman through the Strait of Hormuz. The Gulf of Oman is then linked to the Arabian Sea, which is part of the Indian Ocean. It lies between Iran, to the northeast, and the Arabian Peninsula, to the southwest. The name “Persian” draws from the territory today occupied by Iran, which is not an Arab country. Even after Arabian conquer, Iranians did not lose their language or their separate identity. Ethnic Persians are still 60% of the Iranian population, and Persian is still its most-used language. Also, Iranians are Shiite Muslims, while most Arab countries have a Sunni Muslim majority. All this to say that some governments of Arab countries call it "Arabian Gulf".</p>

    <p>The Gulf of Oman is not a Gulf, but a Strait (as it is not surrounded by water from three sides). It is most often seen as part of the Persian Gulf, not of the Arabian Sea.</p>

    <h3>East China Sea</h3>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/East_China_Sea_Map.jpg" title="East China Sea. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/East_China_Sea_Map.jpg" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">East China Sea. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>The East China Sea is part of the Pacific Ocean. It lays east of the Eastern Coast of China, which includes Shanghai, the largest Chinese city. The Yangtze river formed the river delta you see on Shanghai’s location. It is the longest river in Asia, the third longest in the world. Another city you see on the Yangtze is Nanjing, which was the capital of China in a few periods of its history. We will further study the Yangtze in a later chapter.</p>

    <p>To the west, it borders two Japanese islands. To the south, it borders the island of Taipei, beyond which lays the  South China Sea. To the North, it connects to the Sea of Japan through the Korea Strait.</p>

    <p>The Chinese know it as the “East Sea”, one of the "Four Seas", one for each cardinal direction. The lands “withing the Four Seas” has been a name for China. Of these, we will review the South Sea next. The West Sea is Qinghai Lake, still within the borders of China. Though it is approximately in the center of the Chinese territory, most larger Chinese cities stand East of it. The North Sea is Lake Baikal, today located within Russia, near the southern border with Mongolia.</p>

    <p>There are a few territorial disputes in the East China Sea. The main dispute is between Japan and China on the delineation of their exclusive economic zones ("EEZ").</p>

    <h3>South China Sea</h3>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/South_China_Sea_vector.svg" title="South China Sea.

        <p><i><span class="centerText">South China Sea. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>The South China Sea, a section of the Pacific Ocean, is home to many territorial disputes, which the map above shows quite well. It lays south of Mainland China (and Taiwan), west of the Philippines, east of Vietnam, north of Brunei and the eastern part of Malaysia. The main source of dispute is the Chinese claim to the "South China Sea Islands", the green dots on the map. This would result in most of the South China Sea being inside China’s "exclusive economic zone". The problem is, none of those islands have indigenous peoples, only a few have natural water supply, and some are underwater on high tides. However, this area does hold reserves of oil, gas and minerals, as well as sealife exploitable as food.</p>

    <h3>The Yellow Sea</h3>

    </div>

    <p>The Bay of Bengal is the largest bay in the world. It borders India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar. The Andaman and Nocobar Islands, which belong to India, border it from the East. They also delineate neighboring Andaman Sea. A few rivers flow into the Bay of Bengal. Those include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, two of the most important rivers in India. It holds some of the largest ports in the world, in India and Bangladesh. It gathers particular strategic importance from its position between the Middle East and the Extreme Orient. Both bordering countries and outside powers seek presence in the area.</p>

    <h3>Sea of Okhotsk</h3>

    </div>

    <p>Located on Eastern Russia, the Sea of Okhotsk takes its name from the first Russian settlement in the region. During the colder parts of the year, the fresh water coming from the Amur River freezes, creating a barrier around the coast. When this happens, it is difficult or impossible to navigate in the Sea of Okhotsk. The name for this phenomenon is "ice dam" or "ice jam".</p>

    <h1>7. The main biomes</h1>

    <p>A biome or ecosystem is an area of similar climatic conditions and similar presence of life. The original life forms in a biome either evolved together or merged together at some moment. Excluding human influence, there is ecological balance between life population, geographical formations and climate. Introduced species may disturb this balance, but not always. In a similar way, humans may coexist without disturbing the ecosystem. The degree of disturbance varies according to culture and population size.</p>

    <p>Biomes follow from the climate found in the region. Below you will find a graph showing the biomes formed according to annual rainfall and average temperature.</p>

    <div class="around">

    <h2>Polar Desert</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/AntarcticaDomeCSnow.jpg" title="Polar Desert. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/AntarcticaDomeCSnow.jpg/800px-AntarcticaDomeCSnow.jpg" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Polar Desert. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Polar deserts have low precipitation and a mean temperature, during summer, of less than 10°C. We find polar deserts near Earth’s North and South Pole. Antarctica is not included in the Vegetation Map above, but most of its area would fall under this classification.</p>

    <h2>Tundra</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Tundra_in_Siberia.jpg" title="Tundra. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Tundra_in_Siberia.jpg/800px-Tundra_in_Siberia.jpg" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Tundra. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Tundra forms in areas where the extreme cold and short summers do not allow for tree growth. Unlike in polar deserts, in Tundras you will find small plants such as shrub, grass and moss, as well as lichen. This stark environment does not allow an abundance of animal life, but birds do migrate to tundras for water. There are three types of tundra: Arctic, Alpine and Antarctica. Alpine Tundra forms where high altitudes create an environment akin to the polar environment.</p>

    <h2>Taiga</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Picea_glauca_taiga.jpg" title="Taiga. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Picea_glauca_taiga.jpg" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Taiga in Alaska, US. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>As we move further south from the poles, conifers are the first kind of trees we will find. Taigas are the zone marked by their presence alone among trees. Their leaves are long and thin, some are scale-like, and they are not shed before winter. Conservation of energy is key to survive with little sunlight. Conifers’ leaves do not provide enough nutrients for most animals, but taigas do have more animal life than tundras.</p>

    <h2>Temperate Broadleaf Forest</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Diqing%2C_Yunnan%2C_China.jpg" title="Temperate Broadleaf Forest. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Diqing%2C_Yunnan%2C_China.jpg" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Temperate Broadleaf Forest. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Moving further south, as days and summers become longer, it is important for trees to be able to capture the extra sunlight. For this, they need broad leaves, unlike the hard, needle-like conifer leaves. But these broad leaves cannot withstand winter. For this reason, deciduous trees suck back the nutrients from the leaves, then shed them. This is why they lose the green color. Animal life becomes richer as leaves are more edible.</p>

    <h2>Temperate Steppe</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Steppe_of_western_Kazakhstan_in_the_early_spring.jpg" title="Temperate Steppe in Kazakhstan.

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Temperate Steppe in Kazakhstan. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Going further south, we find Steppe where there isn’t enough water to sustain trees. In these areas we find grasses and shrubs. Temperature variation is great. Between summer and winter, because of proximity to the poles. Between day and night, because low air humidity doesn’t allow for heat retention.</p>

    <h2>Subtropical Rainforest</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Juniper_Springs_Ocala_National_Forest.jpg" title="Subtropical Rainforest in Florida, US.

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Subtropical Rainforest in Florida, US. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Subtropical rainforests enjoy larger precipitation than the previous biomes. Limitations such as short summers and low sunlight are also absent. This allows for more richness of both plant and animal life. Many of the species found on subtropical rainforests are the same found in tropical rainforests. The difference is that less precipitation and lower temperatures make their presence more sparse.</p>

    <h2>Mediterranean Vegetation</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Dehesa_Los_Valhondos_Jamon_BEHER_Bernardo_Hernandez_Salamanca_Pelayos.jpg" title="Mediterranean Forest in Spain.

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Mediterranean Forest in Spain. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>In the Mediterranean we find scrubby but dense vegetation, broad-leaves shrubs, brushes and small trees. These are characteristic of hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Most rainfall happens during winters. There are summer storms, but in general it is subject to many dry months. Mediterranean plant life does not shed leaves before winter - meaning, they are “evergreen”.</p>

    <h2>Monsoon Forest</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Monsoon Forest in the wet season. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Monsoon forests are characteristic of areas subject to monsoon rains, which we will review in a later chapter. These areas have a long dry season followed by a season of heavy rainfall. Some plants shed their leaves during the dry season. We find this biome in Southeast Asia and one typical plant is the bamboo.</p>

    <h2>Arid Desert</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Rub_al_Khali_002.JPG" title="Arid Desert in Saudi Arabia.

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Arid Desert in Saudi Arabia. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Arid regions have a severe lack of humidity, which in turn causes a lack of nutrients, preventing animal and plant life. Because air humidity is low, there are extreme variations in temperature between night and day. Coupled with the lack of plant life to protect the soil, this results in further degradation of rock and nutrients. Nearby mountain ranges are the ultimate cause for some deserts, as they force clouds upwards. In these cases, rain falls on one side of the mountain chain, but not on the other, which then becomes a desert.</p>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <p>Water presence, such as from a passing river carrying nutrient-rich sediment, eases this condition. Oases are another source of water, resulting from springs and outflows of underground water. The result is vegetation and animal life present in the margins of rivers or oases.</p>

    </div>

    <p>As we move away from deserts into more moisture-rich regions, plant life begins to return. Xeric Shrublands are this transition zone. It supports tough and small vegetation, shrubs, which are able to survive with low humidity. Some animal life is present, such as reptiles. Xeric Shrublands are fragile and turn desertic with disruption.</p>

    <h2>Dry Steppe</h2>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <p>In a past section we saw Temperate Steppe. The Dry Steppe is similar, but drier, closer to a desert. In practice, it is difficult to distinguish between the two kinds and even between them and Xeric Shrublands. You will find all three referred to simply as steppes, for example.</p>

    <h2>Semi-Arid Desert</h2>

    <p>Also referred to as steppe sometimes. Semi-deserts are mild deserts, with less temperature variation and higher humidity. For this reason, the soil is not as degraded as explained before. They form in the transition between deserts and more humid areas.</p>

    <p>We find Savannas in regions where the soil is able to sustain forests, but the climate is not humid enough. For this reason, they are fluid and expand or contract according to the conditions found. For example, deforestation of the Amazon Forest in Brazil gives place to “cerrado”, a type of savanna. This deforestation might be man-made, but it may also caused by natural climate fluctuation. A strong rainy season might expand the Amazon Forest and contract the cerrado, for example.</p>

    <h2>Tree Savanna</h2>

    </div>

    <p>Tree Savannas are of course alike grass savannas, the difference being the presence of trees. This can follow from soil profile. The afore-mentioned cerrado itself has two types: <i>cerrado strictu-sensu</i> and <i>cerrado dense</i>. The latter is closer to a grass savanna, while the second is closer to a tree savanna. Though savannas are more open spaces than trees, the tree numbers might be similar. The difference is, higher humidity in forests allow trees to be larger, wider, and as a result their canopy cover a larger area.</p>

    <h2>Subtropical Dry Forest</h2>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <p>Tropical Dry Forests populate areas where, though having a strong rainy season, also sport long dry seasons. Some tree species will shed leaves before the dry season, if they do not have a nearby source of water. As the trees shed leaves, they allow the sunlight to reach the ground, causing grass to grow. This would not happen in a Tropical Rainforest such as the Amazon, where barely any light reaches the soil.</p>

    <h2>Tropical Rainforest</h2>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Amazon Tropical Rainforest in Brazil. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Around the Equator, sunlight is abundant and always present. If precipitation is also supplied year-round, a tropical rainforest forms. There is no need for any shedding of leaves, as there is no dry nor cold season. The climate is always hot, always wet. Plant cover is overwhelming, only around 2% of sunlight reaches the soil. See the photo below for an example.</p>

    </div>

    <p>You might not have a correct impression of a rainforest from watching movies. Traversing a rainforest is difficult, as plants stand close to each other. Dead leaves and other plant material, as well as roots, cover the soil. The temperature is high, there is no wind. You can’t see too far ahead because of all the plants blocking your view. To pass through a virgin rainforest, you need to carry some kind of blade and hack through as you go. They cover some of the hardest areas to explore in the planet, reason why they are sparsely populated and largely unknown.</p>

    <h1>8. The main rivers</h1>

    <p>Rivers are essential to the understanding of human civilization and colonization of the planet. They are useful as a source of fresh water, transport and irrigation. Most exploration of the planet followed courses of rivers and when not present, human presence is small or absent. In history, rivers have been both pathways of war and natural barriers used in strategy. It’s no wonder many national borders follow the courses of rivers.</p>

    <p>The end result is that many major regional divisions of the planet follow from rivers. In turn, Regions are important for understanding the planet and a building block of Geography. For this reason, we will save the study of most rivers for the later part of the course, after this general introduction.</p>

    <p>In this chapter, we will review only the longest and most important rivers. In future chapters, we will delve deeper on them and the life that formed around them.</p>

    <h2>The Rivers of the Fertile Crescent</h2>

    <p>In the South Cone region of South America, three major rivers join together into one major Estuary: the Paraná, the Paraguay and the Uruguay. The massive estuary is by tradition called R&iacute;o de la Plata, meaning “River of the Silver”. “Silver”, in this case, refers not to the color, but to the metal, which also stands for “money” in Spanish. If considered a river, The R&iacute;o de la Plata would be the widest in the world. Its drainage basin includes parts of the South American countries of Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay. It includes the capitals of all these countries, except for Bolivia.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Deserts are dry areas due to receiving low amounts of precipitation - be it from rain, snow, mist or fog. There are four classifications of deserts: hot, cold, semiarid and coastal.</p>

    <p>The understanding of the function of water in the environment is important to explain hot deserts. As explained in an earlier chapter, water functions as a carrier of temperature in nature. In rainforests, nights tend not to be much colder than days for this reason. In hot deserts, because there is little cloud cover during the day, days are hotter than in others environments. Come night, all this heat dissipates for lack of humidity, and it becomes much colder. This great variation of temperature in one day-cycle further degrades rocks. Because this condition has been present for a long time, it has had lasting effect upon the soil and the presence of life. Animals and plants that can survive with little humidity might be present. A topical presence of water form micro-environments, but it cannot have effect over large areas. This is the case of oases and passing rivers.</p>

    <p>Cold deserts are dry because the air is too cold, so there is no evaporation of snow cover. The little precipitation they get fall in the form os snow and accumulates with the snow cover in a similar way to sand. The snow forms dunes and blizzards like sand dunes and sans storms in arid deserts.</p>

    <p>Semiarid deserts form in the transition between deserts and other biomes, as the humidity rises. As we have seen in the biomes chapter, there are many different kinds. They may have short rainy seasons that are not enough to change the landscape from a desert to another biome.</p>

    <p>Coastal deserts are sometimes long and thin, following along a coast and a mountain range. As explained before, the mountains force clouds upwards, causing them to rain, but only on one side. Besides losing humidity, these air currents also lose heat as they move upwards. For this reason, these deserts are also colder and have lower temperature variation in the day-cycle.</p>

    <p>We will now review all deserts in the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deserts_by_area">List of deserts by area</a>" wikipedia article.</p>

    <h2>Antarctica</h2>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Antarctica. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Most of mainland Antarctica is a cold or polar desert. When precipitation occurs, it’s in the form of snow, which accumulates on top of more snow cover. Because snow is white and reflective, it reflects the sunlight, further diminishing heat absorption. Since the snow doesn’t melt or evaporate, the air is also kept dry. Few vegetation other than mosses and fungi are present, and more towards the coast.</p>

    <p>Inside the Antarctica Polar Desert we find the snow-free McMurdo Dry Valleys, one of the most extreme deserts on Earth. See a map and a photograph below.</p>

    <p>The Namib Desert is coastal desert in southern Africa, north of the Kalahari. From the East, the Drakensberg mountains keep moist clouds originated in the Indian Ocean from passing through. Humid air coming from the Atlantic Ocean, west of the desert, turn into fog by contact with warm dry winds coming from the East. As a result, the coastal area of the desert may experience up to 180 days of thick fog a year. Though a navigational hazard responsible for many sunk ships, the moisture is essential for desert life. As a result, the Namib is one of the driest deserts, and with the least precipitation. Most passing by rivers either dry up in the summer or vanish into the desert and there are no lakes. Some scientists believe it is the oldest desert in the world: between 55 and 80 million years old. </p>

    <p>The Dasht-e Kavir, or Great Salt Desert, is a desert in Iran. It receives little rain and snow each year, but there marshes, seasonal lakes and season river beds. Affected by extreme temperatures, they dry, leaving behind large crusts of salt. Human presence is sparse and limited to oases.</p>

    </div>

    <p>A forest is a large area covered with trees or other woody vegetation. They make up for 26% of the world’s land area and contain 80% of the planet’s plant biomass. Different kinds of forest form in different parts of the world for a variety of reasons. In general, there are different kinds when nearer the poles, near the tropics and near the Equator. There are also variations according to altitude. Their size can vary with climate variations, introduction of foreign plant species and human influence. Natural fires and parasites may also contribute to shrinkage of forest area. Difficulty of human settlement or administrative decision might protect them from degradation. They can be set aside for hunting, logging, city climate control and tourism or general aesthetic enjoyment.</p>

    <p>There are many proposed classifications for forests. We will use the one used by the The UN’s Environment Programme’s World Conservation Monitoring Centre. That leaves us at:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Temperate needleleaf;</li>
        <li>Temperate broadleaf and mixed;</li>
        <li>Tropical moist;</li>
        <li>Sparse trees and parkland;</li>
        <li>Forest plantations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let’s go thorugh each of those giving examples.</p>

    <h2>Temperate needleleaf</h2>

    <p>We know Temperate Needleleaf forests from the Taiga and the Montane Forest biomes. Coniferous trees are not only the dominant plant life, but in some cases the only present. We find Temperate Needleleaf forests in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

    </div>

    <p>We find Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed forests both in the North and the Southern Hemisphere. We know it from the “Temperate Broadlef Forest” biome. In the Northern Hemisphere, these forests form as, moving further south, broadleaf trees become possible. Because needleleaf forests are also present, they earn the “mixed” epithet.</p>

    <p>In the Southern Hemisphere, there are no Temperate Needleleaf forests. There, coniferous trees are always found accompanied by their broadleaf counterparts. Some of the countries with forests of this kind are: United States, China, Japan, Chile, Tasmania, Australia, New Zealand. They are also present in the Mediterranean region.</p>

    <p>The "peat" in Peat Swamp comes from the accumulation of dead plant matter on the ground. This happens because the biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition. The accumulation of peat is one of the largest carbon dumps in the planet.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Sparse trees and parkland are transition zones between forest and non-forested areas. One example is the area between tundras and taigas, where trees are present, but not in large numbers. As a result, tree canopy cover is between 10% and 30%. There is high presence of bryophites, such as mosses.</p>

    <h1>11. Tectonic plates and types of mountains and volcanoes</h1>

    <h2>Tectonic plates</h2>

    <p>Again, tectonic plate movement is the most powerful force shaping the planet. The map below shows where the tectonic plates are and in what direction they move.</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Plates_tect2_en.svg" title="Tectonic plates world map.

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Tectonic plates world map. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>The first thing to notice is that some are converging—moving closer—and others diverging—moving apart.</p>

    <h2>Diverging tectonic plates</h2>

    <p>If you search the map for diverging tectonic plates, you will see most diverging areas are under the sea, except for Iceland. The geology of Iceland is unique that way and, as a result, it contains more than 30 active volcanoes and geysers.</p>
    <p>Now you may ask, what makes tectonic plates move? The answer is in this divergence area, something there is pushing the tectonic plates away. The name of the force responsible is "seafloor spreading". Unseen by most people and only recently discovered by scientists, it is one of the most important engines of the planet.</p>
    <p>The solidification of the magma erupted from the exposed area between tectonic plates continually creates volcanoes and seafloor. As this process continues, new seafloor pushes away old seafloor and the tectonic plates themselves, as seen below.</p>

    <div class="around">

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Seafloor spreading. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <h2>Converging tectonic plates</h2>

    <p>When tectonic plates converge, either of two things can happen: one climbs over the other or both rise, pushing against each other. As a result, mountain chains form on the convergence zones over million of years.</p>

    <p>A mountain is a tall landform, usually in the form of a peak, set apart from hills both by their height and by being steeper. Though some mountains stand isolated, most are part of mountain ranges. There are three types: volcanic, fold and block.</p>

    <h2>Volcanic Mountains</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="http://www.bgs.ac.uk/discoveringgeology/hazards/volcanoes/images/tectonics_fig2.png" title="Volcanic formation.

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Volcanic formation. Source: <a href="http://www.bgs.ac.uk/discoveringGeology/hazards/volcanoes/home.html">British Geological Survey</a>.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Volcanic mountains are or have been volcanoes, the result of one tectonic plate sliding over another. When this happens, the magma from under the rising plate comes out to the surface and solidifies, which forms the volcano. Now we see the main types of volcanoes.</p>

    <h3>Stratovolcanoes</h3>

    <p>Where magma eruptions are pre-hardened, they don’t spread over a large area, but instead gather in a cone shape, resulting in stratovolcanoes. They can also be called “composite volcanoes”, as different eruptions pile over each other.</p>

    <h3>Shield volcanoes</h3>

    <p>However, where the magma is more liquid, it tends to be expelled continually for long periods of time and to go further before solidification. The resulting volcano is spread out over hundreds of kilometers and looks like a shield lay flat on the floor.</p>

    <h3>Cinder cone volcanoes</h3>

    <p>Other eruption events are more sudden, erupting in an explosion of lava fountains and volcanic ash under pressure from volcanic gas. The material of the resulting volcano is less compact than found on the previous types, mostly loose rocks of solidified lava. They are cone-shaped and often have a dome on the peak.</p>

    <h2>Fold mountains</h2>

    <p>When two tectonic plates collide, the clashing section of the plates rise and become fold mountains. The material of fold mountains is hard rock, since that’s what we find under the surface. These mountains are still rising after earthquakes.</p>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <h2>Block mountains</h2>

    <p>It is well known that there are faults between the planet’s tectonic plates, but there are faults inside them as well. The bedrock of a tectonic plate is not even, but is instead broken up into fault blocks, some as large as continents. Some fault blocks move vertically in relation to other neighboring fault blocks. Be it upwards or downwards movement, block mountains are the resulting height difference.</p>

    <div class="around">

The following world map features mountain ranges and highland areas in brown and gray colors. It should provide a nice preview of what we are about to dive into.</p>

    <p>On the tectonic plates world map, pay close attention to the main converging plates near land:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>South American Plate against Nazca Plate;</li>
        <li>Cocos Plate and Juan de Fuca Plate against North American Plate;</li>
        <li>Eurasian Plate against Indian Plate;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These correspond to three of Earth’s largest mountain chains:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Andes, ongoing since 500 million years ago</li>
        <li>Rocky Mountains, ongoing since 80 million years ago</li>
        <li>Himalayas, ongoing since 50 million years ago</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The two other of the five largest mountain chains are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Transantarctic Mountains, 65 million years ago, not well understood yet</li>
        <li>Great Dividing Range, 300 million years ago</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will review these and more in the following chapter.</p>

    <h1>12. The main mountain ranges</h1>

    <p>Now we go through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountain_ranges">the 33 longest mountain ranges</a>, from longest to shortest, with the addition of the Pyrenees and of the Ethiopian Highlands. On the map below, you will find all but 2 of the longest mountain ranges, plus the two additions. The two missing are the Mid-Ocean Ridge and the Transantarctic Range. The aim of this chapter is to know where the mountain ranges are, you will find here maps and satellite photographs. On the next chapter we focus on mountains and volcanoes, that’s the place for all the pretty pictures.</p>

    <p>I had to draw free-hand the map below myself, so it is quite inexact, but it provides a general view better than anything I could find on the Internet.</p>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Large mountain ranges World Map. Source: Wikicommons.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Some of the maps on the sections below can be confusing, so come back and find them in the world map above. The ideal is to be able to name every red section in the map.</p>

    <h2>Mid-ocean Ridge</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/World_Distribution_of_Mid-Oceanic_Ridges.gif" title="Mid-ocean Ridge.

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Mid-ocean ridge. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>The mid-ocean ridge is the largest mountain chain in the planet, resulting from the seafloor spreading phenomenom mentioned in the previous chapter. It spans the diverging borders of tectonic plates and is made of underwater volcanoes that can reach up to 1km height.</p>

    <h2>Andes</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Andes.png" title="The Andes, on Western South America. Source: Wikicommons."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Andes.png/556px-Andes.png" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">The Andes, on Western South America. Source: Wikicommons.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Understanding the Andes is essential to understanding South America. It separates a narrow coastal area from the mainland, affecting the climate of most of the continent. The Andes is further broken into many more mountain ranges, or cordilleras, in Spanish. Over the Andes we find large plateaux, wide stretches of high altitude. These are sometimes surrounded by two cordilleras, from the East and from the West. In Spanish, that makes it "Cordillera Occidental" and "Cordillera Oriental", for Occident and Orient.</p>

    <p>The Andes pass by seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. Andesian plateaux hold three South American capitals: Quito, Ecuador; Bogotá, Colombia and La Paz, Bol&iacute;via. As a still growing mountain range, The Andes has several active volcanoes.</p>

    <h2>The Rocky Mountains</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/RockyMountainsLocatorMap.png" title="The Rocky Mountains, stretching through the United States and Canada.

        <p><i><span class="centerText">The Rocky Mountains, stretching through the United States and Canada. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Also known as the Rockies, the Rocky Mountains are the second largest mountain range in the world. Currently, National Parks cover much of it. A common delimitation goes from the Liard River, in Canada, to the Rio Grande, in the United States.</p>

    <p>One related notion is that of the “American Cordillera”. It would include the Rocky Mountains, the Andes, and many other smaller mountain ranges. As an end result, the American Cordillera goes through the entirety of the American Continent, from Alaska to Patagonia. It is evident on the physical world map from the previous chapter.</p>

    <h2>Transantarctic Mountains</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Antarctica_major_geographical_features.jpg" title="Transantarctic Mountains.

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Transantarctic Mountains. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>The Transantarctic Mountains stand between West and East Antarctica. They stretch from the Ross Sea in the south to the Weddell Sea in the north. It is often the only area of Antarctica not covered by ice, due to lack of precipitation. The mountain range is home to the McMurdo Dry Valleys, mentioned in the previous chapter on deserts.</p>

    <h2>Great Dividing Range</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Topography_of_australia.jpg" title="On Eastern Australia, the Great Dividing Range.

        <p><i><span class="centerText">On Eastern Australia, the Great Dividing Range. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>The Great Dividing Range runs through the Eastern Australian Coast. As you may expect from our previous chapters, it has great effect on the Australian climate. The mountain range is a collection of smaller mountain ranges, with both fault block and fold mountains. It is a product of the collision of Australia and what now are South America and New Zealand, some 300 million years ago.</p>

    <h2>Kunlun Mountains</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Tarimrivermap.png" title="Kunlun Mountains. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Tarimrivermap.png/800px-Tarimrivermap.png" alt="" /></a>

    </div>

    <p>The Ural Mountains stretch north from the Arctic Ocean to south, at the Ural River. They are the result of the clashing to two ancient continents, around 300 million years ago, which lasted for 90 million years.</p>

    <h2>Atlas Mountains</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/AtlasRange.jpg" title="Atlas Mountains. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/AtlasRange.jpg/800px-AtlasRange.jpg" alt="" /></a>

    </div>

    <p>The Atlas Mountains stretch across northwestern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean. They pass through Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia.</p>

    <h2>Appalachian Mountains</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Greatvalley-map.png" title="The Appalachians. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Greatvalley-map.png/587px-Greatvalley-map.png" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">The Appalachians. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>The Appalachians run parallel to the coast of the northern part of eastern North America. First formed around 480 million years ago, they reached elevations like found on the Alps and the Rocky Mountains, but have since eroded.</p>

    <h2>Himalayas</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Himalaya_Map.jpg" title="Himalayas Map. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Himalaya_Map.jpg/700px-Himalaya_Map.jpg" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Himalayas Map. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>If you didn’t know anything about the formation of the Himalayas, I’m about to blow your mind. Look at this:</p>

    <p>The Himalayas stand in Asia, between India and China. It is home to 9 of the 10 highest peaks on Earth, including Mount Everest. The melting of its glaciers give rise to three rivers we reviewed before: the Indus, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. The drainage basin of these three rivers house 600 million people today.</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Himalaya-formation.gif" title="Himalayas formation. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Himalaya-formation.gif" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Himalayas formation. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>What we see on the illustration above is the Indian Plate clashing against the Eurasian Plate. As they meet some 50 million years ago, the land that was under the sea between them rose, creating the Himalayan fold mountains. For this reason, you may find sea shells on the peak of Mount Everest today.</p>

    <h2>Altai Mountains</h2>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Altai%2CTienschan-Orte.png" title="Altai Mountains. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Altai%2CTienschan-Orte.png" alt="" /></a>

    <p>The Pyrenees make up a natural border between Spain and France, as well as from mainland Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. It goes from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea.</p>


    <p>Let us now revisit the two mountain chains that make up the border between Europe and Asia. We start with the Ural Mountains, in Russia.</p>

    <h2>Ethiopian Highlands</h2>

    <p>The Ethiopian Highlands are a mass of mountains in Ethiopia, in the Horn of Africa, in the northeastern part of the continent. Its the birthplace of the Blue Nile, which carries sediments to the up to then sterile White Nile.</p>

    <h1>13. The main mountains and volcanoes</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Before we head on to the largest mountains in the world, we need to have a talk about measuring mountains.</p>

    <p>First of all, the most common way to measure a mountain is by its height, meaning elevation above mean sea level. However, a list of peaks by height is boring. Since the Himalayas are so high compared to all other mountain chains, you have to go a long way down to find a mountain from any other region. There are other ways to measure height, some more meaningful and interesting for us.</p>

    <p>There are many ways to measure mountains, more than a dozen. There's "isolation measure", "drop measure" and "spire measure", for example. We will follow for the most part "topographic prominence", which itself has many variances. There's "submarine prominence", "inverse prominence", "dominance" and "proportional prominence", for example.</p>

    <p>Each of these have different results. In "The Finest Peaks: Prominence and other Mountain Measures", for example, Adam Helman describes "spire measure": “attempts to quantify the sense of impressiveness afforded a mountain due to great angularity”. If this seems interesting, there's a list of the top peaks according to the reduced spire measure in the related section.</p>

    <p>So let’s take a moment to understand better the concept of topographic prominence. To start, please take a moment to understand the following image. The vertical lines show the prominence of the peaks.</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Relative-height.svg" title="Topographic prominence. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Relative-height.svg/500px-Relative-height.svg.png" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Topographic prominence. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Topographic prominence is often defined as “the height of a mountain above the saddle of the highest ridge connecting it to a peak higher still”. You may understand prominence as a measure of the independence of a mountain. The largest mountain in an area will score high, "taking the credit" for the whole region. But neighboring peaks will score lower, since they depend on the elevated area for their high elevation. As a result, a list of mountains by prominence correlates better with their cultural presence: they stand out the most.</p>

    <p>That’s enough about this. Now we review a few interesting lists according to different measures, then move on to the mountains by prominence. After that, we will review mountains and volcanoes that are relevant for other reasons.</p>

    <h2>Highest unclimbed mountains</h2>

    <p>A mountain is considered climbed only when someone reaches the peak and comes back alive. Therefore, only half the climb is done upon reaching the peak.</p>
    <p>The first successful climb of Mount Everest was completed in 1953. From then on, K2 became the highest unclimbed mountain on Earth until it was also climbed in 1954. As we keep going, we arrive at the following list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1953- Everest;</li>
        <li>1954 - K2;</li>
        <li>1955 - Kangchenjunga;</li>
        <li>1956 - Lhotse;</li>
        <li>1960 - Dhaulagiri;</li>
        <li>1964 - Xixapangma;</li>
        <li>1964 - Gyachung Kang;</li>
        <li>1974 - Kangbachen;</li>
        <li>1992 - Namcha Barwa;</li>
        <li>Unclimbed: Gangkar Puensum. Because it is located in Bhutan, which forbids mountaineering for religious reasons, it is unlikely that it will be climbed before a change of law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Highest mountains by distance to the center of the planet</h2>
    <p>Because the Earth is not a perfect sphere, but flat on the poles instead, this list is dominated by mountains in places near the Equator.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Chimborazo - Ecuador;</li>
        <li>Huascaran Sur - Peru;</li>
        <li>Yerupaja - Peru;</li>
        <li>Cotopaxi - Ecuador;</li>
        <li>Huandoy - Peru;</li>
        <li>Kilimanjaro - Tanzania;</li>
        <li>Chopicalqui - Peru;</li>
        <li>Huantsan - Peru;</li>
        <li>Cayambe - Ecuador;</li>
        <li>Santa Cruz - Peru;</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Seven Summits</h2>
    <p>The Seven Summits are the highest peaks on each of the seven continents on Earth. The first person to climb all seven was Richard Bass, from the United States, in 1985. Because there are different ways to define the continents, however, the number of peaks can go up to nine. This is the version climbed by Richard Bass:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Aconcagua (South America);</li>
        <li>Everest (Asia);</li>
        <li>Elbrus (Europe);</li>
        <li>Kilimanjaro (Africa);</li>
        <li>McKinley (North America);</li>
        <li>Kosciuszko (Australia);</li>
        <li>Vinson (Antarctica).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most delineations of the continents, as well as the one we followed on an earlier chapter, has Mount Elbrus in Europe. It is, however, in the Caucasus Mountain Chain, bordering Asia. If one were to consider it part of Asia, the highest in Europe becomes Mont Blanc, in the Alps, on the border between Italy and France.</p>
    <p>Bass climbed Mount Kosciuszko to stand for Australia. However, the island of New Guinea is sometimes included in the continent. With the inclusion of New Guinea, the tallest mountain in Australia (the continent) is Puncak Jaya. The image below uses the alternate name of Puncak Jaya: Carstensz Pyramid.</p>

    <h2>The Eight-Thousanders</h2>
    <p>The eight-thousanders are the 14 mountain on Earth taller than 8,000 m, all in the Himalayas. In addition to being a nice round cut-off number, the figure is also relevant to climbers.</p>
    <p>The human body works best at sea-level. At an altitude of 2,100 m, we see the first signs of the effect of decreased atmospheric pressure on human blood. As you climb higher, pressure decreases exponentially, while temperature, only linearly. At the same time, montane climate itself becomes more extreme with height, due to the disturbing presence of the mountain itself. At 8,000 M high, the presence of oxygen in the air drops to one third of normal levels. Without supplementary oxygen, this causes a person to die in a few minutes. The body becomes weaker and the brain can’t function correctly, leading to bad decisions under stress. It was considered impossible to climb the Everest without supplementary oxygen, but Reinhold Messner disagreed.</p>
    <p>These are the eight-thousanders:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mount Everest;</li>
        <li>K2;</li>
        <li>Kangchenjunga;</li>
        <li>Lhotse;</li>
        <li>Makalu;</li>
        <li>Cho Oyu;</li>
        <li>Dhaulagiri I;</li>
        <li>Manaslu;</li>
        <li>Nanga Parbat;</li>
        <li>Annapurna I;</li>
        <li>Gasherbrum I;</li>
        <li>Broad Peak;</li>
        <li>Gasherbrum II;</li>
        <li>Shishapangma.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world and, for this reason, it is also the most famous. The border between China and Nepal runs exactly across its peak, a common occurrence as tall mountains are often used as natural country borders.</p>
    <p>Following the standard route, the Everest is not particularly difficult to climb. The hazards in the venture come from altitude sickness, difficult weather or avalanches. One specially dangerous spot is an icefall of the Khumbu glacier, from which large blocks of ice fall periodically. Many climbers have died trying to cross it. Tenzing Norgay, from Nepal, and Edmund Hillary, from New Zealand, were the first confirmed to climb it, in 1953.</p>

    <h3>Aconcagua</h3>

    <p>Mont Blanc (“White Mountain”, the same in the Italian version of the name) is the tallest mountain in the Alps. It stands on the border between France and Italy.
        It was first climbed in 1786 by the two Frenchmen Jacques Balmat and Michel Paccard. Their feat is considered the birth of modern mountaineering.</p>

    <h2>World Map</h2>

    <p>Now that we have seen all of that, it's only fair we aim for a general view of their locations in the world. I modified the mountain chains map from before to add the top 25 peak by prominence we reviewed above. Take a good look:</p>

    <p>Let's go from left to right. Isolated in the middle of the Pacific, we have Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Next up, Mount McKinley in Alaska, followed by Mount Logan in Canada, then Mount Rainier in the mainland United States. On Central America, we see Pico de Orizaba in Mexico and Volcán Tajumulco in Guatemala. All the way south, in Antarctica, we have Vinson Massif. Now for the Andes, let's go South to North. In Argentina there's Aconcagua. Further north, Chimborazo in Ecuador. Then, in northern Andes, we have Pico Cristóval Colon in Colombia and, a little bit to the East, Pico Bolívar, in Venezuela. Then all the way north in Europe, we see Mont Blanc, in the border between France and Italy. Going towards Asia, in the Caucasus, we see Mount Elbrus. In nearby Iran, south of the Caspian Sea, there's Mount Damavand. Stopping by in Africa, there's Ras Dashen in the Ethiopian Highlands and Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, the largest free-standing mountain, as we have seen.</p>

    <p>Now let's go all the way to the extreme East of Russia, where we see Klyuchevskaya Sopka, the one on that gorgeous photograph blazing in the night under the Milky Way. Now look south to Indonesia, where we see Puncak Jaya, and Malaysia, where we find Mount Kinabalu. Now we're almost done. Two mountains stand in China north of the Himalayas. The eastern one is Jengish Chokusu, in the border between China and Kyrgyzstan. The other one is Bogda Peak. Then, finally, we get to the roof of the planet, the Himalayas. East to West, they are: Nanga Parbat, K2, Mount Everest and Namcha Barwa.</p>

    <h2>The six great north faces of the Alps</h2>

    <p>The expression refers to the sides of six mountains in the Alps considered of exceptional climbing difficulty. Gaston Rébuffat, a Frenchman, was the first to climb all six in the 1950's. Here are images of each one:</p>

    <h1>14. Caves</h1>

    <p>There are several types of caves, but we will review only the most important. In general, a cave would be an area under the surface that is large enough for parts of it not to receive sunlight. Some are openings into rock, others are large areas under the ground big enough for a person to explore. Let's go through the types and see a few examples of each.</p>

    <h2>Cave types</h2>

    <h3>Shallow caves</h3>

    <p>Let's start with a few types of small and shallow caves.</p>

    <h4>Rock shelters</h4>

    <p>Rock shelters are useful as protection against the weather. They were often used by pre-historic men, making some important archelogical sites.</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Rock_shelter_Papula.jpg" title="Rock shelter in Europe. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Rock_shelter_Papula.jpg" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Rock shelter in Europe. Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rock_shelter_Papula.jpg">Wikipedia</a>.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <h4>Grottos</h4>

    <p>Another name for shallow caves, grottos can be either man-made or natural. Since the apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes, in France, 1858, they have been used for Catholic shrines.</p>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <h4>Sea caves</h4>

    <p>Sea caves are the result of wave erosion acting on coastal rock. The largest is Matainaka Cave, in New Zealand, which is 1.5 km long.</p>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <h3>Solutional caves</h3>

    <p>Solutional caves are the most common, formed in soluble rocks over time, dissolved by the natural acidity in water. A few soluble rock types are: limestone (most common), chalk, dolomite, marble, salt and gypsium. As a result of the water seeping in from above, these caves feature speleothems, special formations of rock. The image below shows the most common speleothems.</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Labeled_speleothems.jpg" title="The most common types of speleothems.

    </div>

    <p>The most famous are stalactites (on the ceiling) and stalagmites (on the floor). When connected, these form a column. The image below shows many more types of speleothems. Head on over to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speleothem">Wikipedia article on speleothems</a> to see it further explained.</p>

    <h3>Primary caves</h3>

    <p>This classification applies to caves formed at the same time as the surrounding rock—that is, not by erosion. The most common are lava tubes, the result of a special way of lava solidification.</p>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <h3>Corrasional or erosional caves</h3>

    <p>Formed by erosion, caused by water or wind. Some solutional caves start that way, then are flooded by a stream of water, which enlarges the hollow area.</p>

    <div class="around">

    <h1>15. The climate</h1>

    <p>This is a crash course in basic Climatology, the science charged with studying the climate.</p>

    <p>The distinction between climate and weather is fundamental. Climate refers to long term patterns, while weather is the climate condition in a short period—a day, for example.</p>

    <p>The single most important factor to the climate is the Sun and how it doesn’t shine in the entire planet the same way. In the image below, you see that the Earth is tilted as it circles around the Sun. However it does also spin. As a result, there is a large region near the Equator that faces straight at the Sun. The regions far from the Equator face the Sun from an angle, so they get less sunlight.</p>

    <div class="around">

    <p>The following image shows the intertropical convergence zone between the tropics: Cancer and Capricorn. From the tropics to the arctic and antarctic circles, we have the temperate zones. From the arctic and antarctic circles to the poles, we see the frigid zones. Insulation is different for each of these zones.</p>

    <p>The Earth does not rotate around the Sun in a circle, but in an ellipses. Because of this, the Sun is closer in some parts of the year than in others. In the temperate zone, where sunlight is already lower, that is enough to cause the seasons. Around the Equator, always facing squarely at the Sun, the difference isn’t as great and there are no seasons. However, since the global climate is one entire system, it also faces changes: a rainy season and a dry season.</p>

    <h2>The Atmosphere</h2>

    <p>On the image below, you will see the layers of the atmosphere. Only the troposphere and the stratosphere are of concern to us.</p>

    <div class="around">

    </div>

    <p>Most human activity, except for high-altitude aviation and spaceflight, happens in the troposphere. The stratosphere is relevant to us for two reasons: it is home to the jet stream and to the ozone layer.</p>

    <h3>Composition</h3>

    <p>Earth’s atmosphere consists roughly of:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>78% nitrogen;</li>
        <li>21% oxygen;</li>
        <li>1% other gases.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both Nitrogen and Oxygen are abundant because they are heavy enough not to escape the atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions expelled the nitrogen gas and living organisms created the oxygen, over billions of years through photosynthesis. The 1% of other gases includes ozone, carbon dioxide, water and others. Both ozone and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases, they help keep heat from the Sun in the planet surface. Without the greenhouse effect Earth would freeze, being unable to hold heat generated by the Sun. With a stronger greenhouse effect, the planet would become warmer. Photosynthesis, the origin of all the oxygen, uses carbon dioxide. In turn, it protects the same living organisms from genetic damage by ultraviolet from the Sun.</p>

    <h2>Atmospheric Circulation</h2>

    <p>Alright, so it’s warmer in the Equator, it’s a little colder in the tropics and much colder in the poles. All that differently-heated air doesn’t just stay where it is. This is the most important knowledge you have to take out of this chapter. Everything that happens next in the climate follows from this difference in temperature: the result is "atmospheric circulation".</p>

    <p>Atmospheric circulation is the movement of air throughout the atmosphere of the planet. It follows from the second law of thermodynamics, as the different sections of the planet exchange heat. Without the input of more heat from the Sun, this would result in entropy: the entire atmosphere would end with the same temperature. However, because the Sun heats the Equator more than the tropics and the poles every day, the process never stops.</p>

    <p>Moving air is how atmospheric heat gets exchanged around: that's wind. The warm winds of the Equator blow to the tropics. The medium-warm winds of the temperate zone blow to the Equator and to the poles. The cold winds of the poles blow to the tropics or in a spiral around the poles, trapped. The result is what you see below.</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/AtmosphCirc2.png" title="Idealized atmospheric circulation. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/AtmosphCirc2.png" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Idealized atmospheric circulation. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>So, we have one “cell” for each of the zones mentioned before. The Hadley Cell around the Equator, the Ferrel Cell between the tropics and the poles and the Polar Cell in the poles. On the image, the blue arrows are cold winds, the red arrows are warm winds.</p>

    <p>Before we go into more detail, please notice the directions of surface wind. Around the Equator, surface wind blows West and toward the Equator. In the Ferrel Cell, surface wind blows East and toward the poles. In the poles, surface wind blows West and toward the tropics. The words in yellow are the names of each of those winds: trade winds, westerlies and polar easterlies. However, in reality winds don’t follow exactly that pattern because they function differently over land and sea. We will see a “real” wind map further below.</p>

    <p>You may notice that as well as moving across the planet, winds also move vertically. This happens because cold air is heavier than hot air. As the hot air moves upward, however, it also cools down, becoming cold air. It then moves downward, as hot air takes its place. The Hadley Cell is so tall because warm winds meet in the Equator and there’s only one way from there: up.</p>

    <p>There is one other wind movement we can observe. We have accounted for vertical movement and for movement across the planet. The latter doesn’t happen in a straight line though, and we haven’t accounted for that. The cold winds in the Hadley Cell move from east to west due to the Coriolis effect. As the Earth spins around its axis east to west, it drags the atmosphere, but not as much as the land. So a wind moving north while the Earth spins, when plotted on a stationary map, will seem to curve. Read that again, take a look at the map, look at the image below and try to wrap your mind around it.</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Corioliskraftanimation.gif" title="Representation of the Coriolis Effect. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Corioliskraftanimation.gif" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Representation of the Coriolis Effect. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Now that we have understood what traces the path of winds, let’s go through each of the three cells.</p>

    <h3>The Hadley Cell</h3>

    <p>Please take a moment to observe the Hadley Cell in the image from before.</p>

    <p>As the sun heats the surface near the Equator, the air becomes hotter and rises, carrying humidity. It is then replaced by cold and dry air from the higher troposphere, which proceeds to warm up and gain humidity near the surface. Meanwhile, the hot and humid air forms rain clouds and, with altitude, becomes colder and rains down, losing humidity and mass. The now lost water in the air stored most of the heat, so the air becomes cold and dry again, so it falls back down to the surface. The end result is clear: heavy rainfall in the intertropical convergence zone, which the Hadley Cell covers. The word “Convergence” comes from the northeast and the southeast trade winds coming together.</p>

    <h3>The Polar Cell</h3>

    <p>Now let’s compare that to what happens in the poles. Because there isn’t as much heat from the Sun in the poles, the air is cold and dry. However, the air at the Arctic and Antarctic circles is still warmer than the air right on the poles, since it is in constant exchange with the warmer winds of the Ferrel Cell. This difference of temperature causes this warmer air to go toward the pole, where it rapidly cools off again. As a result, the poles function as a heat sink: whatever heated and humid air comes in contact with it, becomes cold and dry. Because it is so cold in the poles, the humidity does not fall as rain, but as snow. This sets the stage for the polar deserts we mentioned in the biomes chapter.</p>

    <h3>The Ferrel Cell</h3>

    <p>Now we circle back to analyze the Ferrel Cell, between the tropics and the arctic and antarctic circles. The Ferrel Cell receives both cold and dry air from the poles and warm and humid air from the intertropical convergence zone. The question is, which wins, that is, which is stronger? The answer is, it depends on the time of the year. When the Earth is closer to the Sun—during Summer—the warm winds of the Equator dominate. But when the Earth is further away from the Sun—during Winter— the cold winds of the poles expand and escape.</p>

    <p>In the Ferrel Cell region, we find the westerlies winds.</p>

    <h2>Winds</h2>

    <p>Due to interactions between land and sea, the winds do not follow the general path outlined in the previous map. Below is the “real” wind map I mentioned before.</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Map_prevailing_winds_on_earth.png" title="Winds world map. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Map_prevailing_winds_on_earth.png/800px-Map_prevailing_winds_on_earth.png" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Winds world map. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>In blue, you have the westerlies. In yellow, the northeasterly trade winds. In orange, the southeasterly trade winds. The regions marked with the green and pink numbers are low-pressure areas. We will explain more about those later.</p>

    <p>To understand the addition of land into this process, this is the most important fact: land warms faster than water, but also cools faster. As a result, in the warmer months land area will be warmer than the ocean. However, in the cold months the ocean keeps the heat it gets for longer, while land loses it faster. As a result, the ocean will be warmer than the land.</p>

    <h3>Northeast and Southeast trade winds</h3>

    <p>The northeast and southeast trade winds are cold surface winds moving from the Poles to the Equator. Both flow east to west due to the Coriolis Effect.</p>

    <p>The Northeast trade winds allowed European expansion into the Americas. In a similar way, they carry hurricanes to the Caribbean and North America and cyclones to Asia.</p>

    <h3>Westerlies</h3>

    <p>The Westerlies, or anti-trades, blow in the opposite direction of the trade winds. During winter, when the polar winds are strongest, the Westerlies also increase in strength.</p>

    <h3>The Coriolis Effect</h3>

    <p>Now why do the Westerlies flow East, while the trade winds flow West? As we have seen before, without the Coriolis Effect winds would blow in a straight line, either North or South. Here’s the difference: the trade winds are escaping from the Equator, blowing to the poles. However, the Westerlies are escaping from the poles, blowing toward the Equator. Considering this, here is how it works due to the coriolis effect:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Northern Hemisphere:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Moving <b>north to south</b>: winds <b>turn west</b> (northern hemisphere trade winds);</li>
            <li>Moving <b>south to north</b>: winds <b>turn east</b> (northern hemisphere westerlies);</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Southern Hemisphere:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Moving <b>north to south</b>: winds <b>turn east</b> (southern hemisphere westerlies);</li>
            <li>Moving <b>south to north</b>: winds <b>turn west</b> (southern hemisphere trade winds);</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Monsoon</h3>

    <p>The Monsoon winds affects the region surrounding the Indian Ocean: West Africa, South-East Asia and Australia. You may remember Monsoon Forests were one kind of biome we studied before. That biome shows one dry season and one wet season, when under the effect of monsoon rains, which the monsoon winds cause.</p>

    <p>The different heating rates between land and water come in to play to explain the monsoons. During summer, the Indian Ocean is colder than the land surrounding it. As a result, the air over land rises and is replaced by cool and wet air from the ocean. Upon reaching land, however, these winds are forced upward, which cools them further, releasing the humidity as rain. Those are the monsoon rains. This colder air then returns to the ocean, since it tends downward, like a waterfall from high land to low ocean.</p>

    <p>This whole process happens in a similar manner to generate coastal winds all over the world, but it is more intense in the monsoon region. Slight differences happen throughout Asia, but this explanation is detailed enough for our purposes.</p>

    <h3>Jet stream</h3>

    <p>For all the talk about the interaction between land and water and its effect on winds patterns, there is one type that is not affected. Jet streams are so high up, between the troposphere and the stratosphere, that land and sea cover does not factor into its functioning.</p>

    <p>Jet streams are fast and narrow air currents. They flow roughly between the three cells of atmospheric circulation: along the tropics and along the arctic and antarctic circles.</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Jetstreamconfig.jpg" title="Jet streams. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Jetstreamconfig.jpg" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Jet stream. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Their practical importance lies in shortening travel times for airplanes that fly high enough to meet them. They are important for the climate because they steer storms. For example, in both 2007 and 2012 intense storms hit Britain due to changes in the polar jet stream in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

    <h2>Atmospheric Pressure</h2>

    <p>Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted on everything on the surface by the weight of the Atmosphere. It is not easily apparent, but if you close an empty bottle on a mountain top, where the Atmosphere around you is rare and light, and then bring the bottle to the ocean level, the heavier atmosphere there will crush that bottle.</p>

    <p>Other than mountaintops, we also find low atmospheric pressure on deserts. That’s because the air warm and moving upward, so it doesn’t exert much force downward.</p>

    <p>High pressure areas are more important to us. Think back at the three atmospheric circulation cells, and how other than surface winds, they also had winds in the upper troposphere. Wherever you have cold winds coming down from two different atmospheric circulation cells in a same area, the pressure will be higher than in other places. In the same way, wherever you have warm wind going upward from two bordering cells, you have low pressure. Please take a look at the atmospheric circulation map with the green planet and find the blue H’s and the red L’s. Those are high and low atmospheric pressure regions.</p>

    <p>So, what happens there? First of all, in low-pressure areas the winds are stronger, since warm air, because it is lighter, moves faster than cold air. It also rains, since the hot air moving upward carries humidity, which then rains down as the air cools.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in high-pressure areas you have clear skies, as the air is dry. The lack of cloud cover also exposes the land to direct sunlight, but since there are no clouds to accumulate the heat, temperatures are lower.</p>

    <p>All would be fine if it were not for the Coriolis Effect. Again, because the Earth is spinning, all this motion tends to happen in a circular pattern. This is the result:</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Hurricane-en.svg" title="Structure of a Hurricane (in the Northern Hemisphere). Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Hurricane-en.svg/800px-Hurricane-en.svg.png" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Structure of a Hurricane (in the Northern Hemisphere). Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Winds are stronger where the temperature difference that causes them to exist is larger. In low-atmospheric pressure areas, this difference can be very large and be created very fast because all that rising, wet and warm air cools off fast. As long as there’s warm water to keep the process going, it doesn’t stop. That’s why hurricanes damage coastal cities, but doesn’t go much farther. Once the hurricane is over land, it lacks fuel—the warm and wet winds—to keep it going.</p>

    <h2>Ocean circulation</h2>

    <p>So all that happens in the atmosphere, but what about the oceans? After all, ocean heat is also uneven based on distance to the Equator. In a similar way to Atmospheric Circulation, we have Ocean Circulation, resulting in the Thermohaline circulation, or the “global conveyor belt”.</p>

    <p>They are important for the weather in many ways, but especially because warm currents help warm up surface winds.</p>

    <h3>Global Conveyor Belt</h3>

    <p>As a result of Ocean circulation, ocean currents follow the dynamics pictured below.</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Conveyor_belt.svg" title="The Global Conveyor Belt. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Conveyor_belt.svg/343px-Conveyor_belt.svg.png" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">The Global Conveyor Belt. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>Again, the red and blue lines mean warm and cold currents, this time with a twist. Because only the surface of water heats up, deep currents are cold, while surface currents are warm. You can see two areas near the poles labeled “deep water formation”, where surface currents cool off and move deeper underwater. You may also notice that in two areas the cold currents warm up and rise to the surface: the eastern coast of Africa and the Pacific Ocean.</p>

    <p>Possibly the most striking feature of the image is the circle around Antarctica, with warm currents on the outside and cold currents on the inside. That’s the Antarctic Circumpolar current, part of the previously mentioned perpetual storm raging around Antarctica.</p>

    <p>Something you might not notice at a glance is that, on the Northern Hemisphere, currents run clockwise while, on the Southern Hemisphere, they flow counter-clockwise. Just as before, that’s a result of the Coriolis 	Effect.</p>

    <p>Knowledge of ocean currents was essential up to the steam-era and is still important to lower transoceanic travel costs.</p>

    <p>Below you will find a world map of the main ocean currents. Put together with the global conveyor belt map, we will now examine the system by breaking it down into parts.</p>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Ocean surface currents. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <h3>Gulf Stream</h3>

    <p>In the global conveyor map, take a moment to find the warm current going from Antarctica through the Atlantic Ocean to the North Pole. In the ocean currents world map, you will see it has been broken up into the following currents:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Benguela;</li>
        <li>South Equatorial;</li>
        <li>North Equatorial;</li>
        <li>Caribbean;</li>
        <li>Loop;</li>
        <li>Gulf Stream;</li>
        <li>North Atlantic;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Of these, the Gulf Stream is of special importance. It warms up the eastern coast of North America and the western coast of Europe by carrying warm currents from the Equator.</p>

    <p>Europeans have known about it since the 16th century, and Spanish ships used it to travel from the Caribbean back to the homeland. In the 18th century, it was further studied by the American Benjamin Franklin, leading to significant gains in travel.</p>

    <p>The current shape of the Gulf Stream—and thus of the entire global conveyor belt—developed from the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, 12 to 15 million years ago. Before then, ocean currents would flow from the Atlantic to the Pacific and both Eastern North America and Western Europe were colder. This makes the creation of the Isthmus of Panama one of the most important geological events on Earth.</p>

    <h3>Humboldt Current</h3>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Humboldt_current.jpg" title="The Humboldt Current. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Humboldt_current.jpg" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">The Humboldt Current. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <p>The Humboldt Current is named Peru/Chile in the ocean currents world map. It consists of cold currents from the South Pole, flowing north along the south american west coast. As a result, it makes Chile and the Peruvian coast colder. The Humboldt Current is home to one of the richest marine life ecosystems in the world.</p>

    <h3>Agulhas Current</h3>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Benguela_and_Agulhas_Currents.jpg" title="The Agulhas Current.

    <p>The Agulhas Current, seen above, delayed Portuguese exploration of the Indian Ocean.</p>

    <h2>The end-result</h2>

    <p>Below you will find a climate world map based on the Köppen climate classifications. It somewhat correlates with the biomes world map we have seen before, but let’s examine it from the perspective of the climate.</p>

    <div class="around">

        <a id="image" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/ClimateMap_World.png" title="Climate World Map. Source: Wikipedia."> <img class="fitImage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/ClimateMap_World.png" alt="" /></a>

        <p><i><span class="centerText">Climate World Map. Source: Wikipedia.</span></i></p>

    </div>

    <h3>Ice cap, highlands, non-permanent ice, tundra and the subarctic</h3>

    <p>In Greenland and Antarctica, we have “Ice cap”, meaning that those areas are permanently covered in ice. There’s an important distinction to be made here. “Ice sheets” or “continental glaciers” are ice covers with an area greater than 50,000Km2. There are two of them in the planet: on Greenland and on Antarctica. We call “ice caps” anything smaller, from mountaintop glaciers to the frozen Arctic. The ice cap climate region, which is not the same as an ice cap in general, covers both ice caps and ice sheets.</p>

    <p>This is confusing because we find ice caps on the “highlands” climate region. These are some of the tallest mountain chains we studied before, you should be able to identify them.</p>

    <p>In addition to this, and keeping with the "ice" theme, we have the non-permanent ice areas. This is a sort of alternate to the "ice cap" classification.</p>

    <p>The subarctic and tundra regions are cold due to proximity to the Arctic. As we have seen, they are covered by the tundra and taiga biomes.</p>

    <h3>Humid continental and Humid subtropical</h3>

    <p>Humid continental areas feature the classic four seasons system, shielded from a greater influence of rain-carrying winds by their inner placing.</p>

    <p>In contrast, Humid subtropical areas are typically on eastern coasts, receiving rainfall from westerlies winds.</p>

    <h3>Marine west coast and Mediterranean</h3>

    <p>Ever heard that in London or Seattle it rains a lot? That’s the marine west coast climate, constantly affected by rain-carrying westerlies winds (which, you must remember, travel east to west). These are the same rains affected by rainshadow, and you can see the resulting deserts in the map.</p>

    <p>The Mediterranean climate, just like the biome, shows hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. </p>

    <h3>Arid and Semiarid</h3>

    <p>We are well familiarized with this condition from the biomes chapter. These areas receive very low amounts of rain.</p>

    <h3>Tropical wet and Tropical wet and dry</h3>

    <p>We also know both of these from their respective biomes. In tropical wet areas we see tropical rainforests. In tropical wet and dry, tropical and subtropical dry forests. We distinguish them by the amount of rain they receive.</p>
