can keep in your mind. I&rsquo;ve read my share of books that I couldn&rsquo;t afterward quite remember, or of which I could only remember snippets. A solution to this can be found in the wonderful and essential How to Read a Book, by Mortimer J. Adler.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>However, Adler&rsquo;s system, which works perfectly for the hard study expected of a true intellectual, is not something we could reasonably expect for everyone to practice for most books they read. At the same time, there&rsquo;s very little to be gained from reading a book only for the pleasure of the moment, even though it will quench an intelligent brain&rsquo;s constant need for stimulation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>And yet, books and learning are not only for serious intellectuals with solid work ethic. There are important facts that citizens of a free society must be aware of, otherwise it will not be free much longer. We have a global society now, but it is filled with ignorant slaves, obsessed with how much value they can extract from their masters, the modern States, be it rights, security or their monthly allowance. And we are weak, weaker than any people have ever been in history before being invaded and destroyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>A weak and enslaved man needs many things to free himself and his family. Most of them are not in this book, but it does concern itself with two of such things: knowledge of his surroundings (now, the planet) and tales of strength and bravery. I have found these things to go together well: once you can picture in your mind these places and what has happened in them, the geography of the planet becomes a strong memory, illuminated by its significance to our forefathers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>This is important to avoid forgetting, the fate of some, maybe most book reading. I tried to write a book that could be remembered, that could in its entirety become part of your memory bank and inform your decisions. In a way, that&rsquo;s why I wrote it. Most people don&rsquo;t realize that most books were written for this: not to teach, but to learn. As I write this Introduction after having finished the purely geographic part of the book, I wonder what tales I will find out to have happened on the face of the planet. Tales of people who are our ancestors and whom I hope we would not embarrass, we the weak, living our comfortable lives and not standing, but sitting leisurely on the shoulders of giants, blindfolded.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c0 c4 c13"><a id="h.b28behbzi9i7" name="h.b28behbzi9i7"></a></h1><h1 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.rm1z48uk8o3e" name="h.rm1z48uk8o3e"></a><span>The Geologic Time Scale</span></h1><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.aa3jyvwp645m" name="h.aa3jyvwp645m"></a><span>Extremely broad strokes</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The planet has existed for 4.54 billion years.

As a result, we&rsquo;re left with the Precambrian supereon and the Phanerozoic eon. The cutting point between the two is the Cambrian Explosion, when life on the planet suddenly exploded and became more abundant. This happened in the Phanerozoic Eon, Paleozoic Era, Cambrian Period.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>After the Paleozoic Era, comes the Mesozoic Era (the first of the Phanerozoic Eon). This is the Era of the dinosaurs, with three Periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. The change from the Mesozoic Era of the Cretaceous Period to the Cenozoic Era of the Paleogene Period is quite familiar to most people: it&rsquo;s the Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction Event, which happened 66 million years ago.

You may think of the entire Paleozoic Era as the building up of living organisms on the Planet, from microorganisms to dinosaurs.</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>After the Paleozoic Era, we have the Mesozoic Era. You can think of this as the Era of dinosaurs.</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>Once the dinosaurs are extinct, their era is over and the mammals take over.

It&rsquo;s force is about a billion times that of the atomic bombs used on Japan at the end of World War 2.</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>As a result of the impact, the atmosphere of the planet caught on fire for a brief time, incinerating the surface. Longer-lasting firestorms formed on the planet after this, causing further destruction.

Mammal species grew 10% in size in the following millions of years.</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>The meteor impact also caused longer-lasting global climate change, a so-called &ldquo;impact winter&rdquo;, a rise of the sea level and the occurrence of mega tsunamis that caused further destruction.</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span>After the meteor, we get into the Cenozoic Era. This is when the continents assume the shapes we know today.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.g0vaflz8enys" name="h.g0vaflz8enys"></a><span>On Geology</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The above is but a tiny share of the priceless treasure of geologic knowledge of the planet, which we fortunately have geologists to guard and expand upon. I firmly believe an intelligent man must not ignore any science in its entirety. Memorizing the above facts alone and moving on to the next chapter would be to act as a parasite of knowledge, or simply a slave, with no stakes in anything larger than himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>It is expected you should know the important dates of your country&rsquo;s history. For most countries, that includes an independence day. For others, revolutions or wars of importance. The significance of these dates, however, is that it is our responsibility to keep them. The slavish masses of today reap the effects of these deeds without adding to their legacy, and thus inch toward losing them. In the same manner, if we have no understanding of how the main dates of our planet&rsquo;s history were established, we are like children, receiving knowledge we do not understand. This is not a children&rsquo;s book, much less a guide on being a good slave, so we now proceed to understand the basic notions of Geology.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Geology is one of the noblest sciences, the study of this planet and, after recent developments, of other celestial bodies as well. A good definition of Geology is always wide enough that it will make you believe every geologist to be megalomaniac, concerned with the affairs of a dozen lesser sciences. They will study the highest layer of the atmosphere, the deepest core of the planet and everything in between. The moment the first man considered a type of stone to be more proper for something than another type, he was the first geologist. That was certainly essential knowledge, as Geology still is very much essential today. This is important to distinguish it from sciences that have lost its importance (such as Geography), that have never been important (such as Sociology and Anthropology) or that have prostituted themselves to power and weakness (such as Medicine, Psychology and Philosophy).</span></p><p class="c0"><span>All great civilizations of the past have studied the planet, but the earliest works known come from Ancient Greece, by a man called Theophrastus, the successor of Aristotle as head of the Lyceum, his Philosophy school. It is certain that Aristotle himself had written on the subject, though most of his works have been lost. For example, Aristotle wrote about fossils of seashells found in rocks and inferred that the positions of land and sea had changed and that these changes had happened slowly over a long period of time. Another Ancient Greek, Eratosthenes, was capable of calculating the circumference of the Earth with remarkable accuracy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Nicolas Steno (1638-1686), a Danish and one of the founders of modern Geology, is credited with three important principles of Geology, that is, basic facts about the planet that can be used as guides to understand direct experience and expand knowledge: the law of superposition, the principle of original horizontality and the principle of lateral continuity. As a group, they mean that older material is found under new material, deposited horizontally in all directions until a barrier is met. This is how many fossils are dated by archeologists: they know when the soil around the fossil was deposited. Steno was a true scientist, having contributed to knowledge of Anatomy and, in a manner related to is studies in Geology, of Paleontology, Stratigraphy and Crystallography, the study of crystals, where he is credited for the First Law of Crystallography, which states that the angles between the faces of crystals and solids are constant for every example of the same type. Raised as a Lutheran, he converted to Catholicism and later became a Catholic Bishop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>James Hutton (1726-1797), a Scottish, considered the first modern geologist, is credited with another principle of geology, Uniformitarianism, which states that the past experienced the same natural laws we experience today. At the time, it meant to reject explanations based on catastrophes, that is, unique and powerful events. Though now we know that such events can occur (such as the extinction of the dinosaurs), it is still valid for the larger part of geological features. He also proposed, correctly, that the interior of the Earth was hot and the engine of creation of new rock, expelled by volcanoes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>In 1850, Sir Charles Lyell (1797-1875), a British, published his Principles of Geology. This widely important book influenced Charles Darwin and helped establish the basis of the science.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>As technology and general scientific knowledge grew, Geology continued useful and illuminating. New technologies allowed progressively better estimations of the planet&rsquo;s age. The knowledge, since the 19th century, that the Earth might be several billion years old, enlarged its explanatory scope enough that the theory of plate tectonics could be developed in the 20th century: the continents themselves move across the planet, extremely slowly, but over billions of years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Through the study of Geology, you will understand how geographical features around you came to be and what the types of rock are. It enables you to, for example, find out how likely it is that there is oil underneath the ground, and how deep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>There are three kinds of rock: sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous. They transform into each other in a system called &ldquo;the rock cycle&rdquo;, illustrated below.</span></p><a href="#" id="b3f4d1fd4e5d66a385ba3d2088a112b9b909d8f3" name="b3f4d1fd4e5d66a385ba3d2088a112b9b909d8f3"></a><a href="#" id="2" name="2"></a><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="c17"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0 c19"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 584.00px; height: 503.78px;"><img alt="1044px-Rockcycle.jpg" src="images/image03.jpg" style="width: 584.00px; height: 503.78px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15 c0"><span>Source: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rockcycle.jpg&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1453847062636000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGpbGgynDRPffW3Od9KwHgfy5HyYg">Wikipedia</a></span><span class="c6">.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><ol class="c1 lst-kix_unm0kq7l7g9q-0 start" start="1"><li class="c15 c0 c8 c9"><span class="c6">magma;</span></li><li class="c15 c0 c8 c9"><span class="c6">crystallization;</span></li><li class="c15 c0 c8 c9"><span class="c6">igneous rock;</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9 c15"><span class="c6">erosion;</span></li><li class="c15 c0 c8 c9"><span class="c6">sedimentation;</span></li><li class="c15 c0 c8 c9"><span class="c6">sediments and sedimentary rocks;</span></li><li class="c15 c0 c8 c9"><span class="c6">tectonic burial and metamorphism;</span></li><li class="c15 c0 c8 c9"><span class="c6">metamorphic rocks;</span></li><li class="c15 c0 c8 c9"><span class="c6">melting.</span></li></ol></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>There is one important notion you have take out of all this: the Earth is not in a resting state.

The reason why you have to clean the dust from your house is that your entire city is being continually covered by dirt, to become an archeological site that has to be dug out in thousands of years. That&rsquo;s what happened with the archeological sites under modern cities. The Grand Canyon wasn&rsquo;t created millions of years ago, it started being created then, and still is with every drop of water that the Colorado River runs through the valley that cuts the canyon.

Around 30,000 years ago, Neanderthals were either extinct or simply dissolved by interbreeding with humans.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.4gie33jfv23n" name="h.4gie33jfv23n"></a><span>Homo sapiens sapiens</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>All those </span><span class="c7">Homo sapiens sapiens</span><span>&nbsp;lived as nomadic hunter-gatherers all over the world. Their diet consisted mostly of scavenged vegetables&mdash;fruits, berries, nuts&mdash;and meat from hunting. It was a difficult and dangerous life, as people still did not have dominion over nature. The most important advancement from then on was the accumulation of knowledge. It allowed them to outperform every other predator and every other subspecies of human evolution. This upgrade came not from further evolution, but by the accumulation of experience and knowledge. With the development of Agriculture, societies became more complex and thus more powerful. Man becomes the wolf of man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>At around 11,000 b.C, the end of the last Ice Age, humans start to live in villages. Within a few thousand years, plant and animal domestication begins. By then humans had reached the Americas. They were still to reach Madagascar and New Zealand&mdash;the large islands next to Africa and Australia, respectively.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Africa has so many large mammals today because they evolved together with humans, learning to fear them. By contrast, both in the Americas and in Australia, the arrival of humans meant the doom of native large mammals. For example, Australia had giant kangaroos and the Americas had giant ground sloths and mammoths. All were consumed by men, which they were not prepared to react against.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Wherever humans reached, they spread and multiplied fast.

It is easy today to forget that, but everyone alive has that inherited strength in them. Think back to the region your people come from, their history, the trials they had to surpass. They may have been weak in comparison to other people, who later invaded and conquered them, but they were not weak in their own environment, otherwise they would have been destroyed before the arrival of the foreign forces. Whether they fought back or joined the newcomers with an eye to the advantages that could be gained, it does not matter, there is honor in both choices. It is not smart to reinvent from scratch the wheel, or the rifle, if you can buy one through honest work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Our forefathers persevered against stronger and faster animals, against the dangers of both scarcity and abundance, against unrelenting climatic conditions of every kind to be found on Earth, except for Antarctica. They did this through intelligence, the accumulation of knowledge and the improvement of their bodies. Invariably, they did this as free men, since the State is a much more modern invention. The mightiest kings of Antiquity never had the power over the individual, nor the enormous numbers of people, that the modern States enjoy today. You do not need it, you never have before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>If all civilization were to crumble, humanity would not be destroyed, because we have it in ourselves this capacity we can always revert back to. To survive, you do not need the State, your job or your extended family. Your immediate family could join half a dozen other like-minded families and together you could found a city from the ground up. Together, you could create your own laws, your reason and common sense would be all you need to do so. You carry in you the legacy of people who have done just that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>In my opinion, Jared Diamond&rsquo;s &ldquo;Guns, Germs and Steel&rdquo; is a modern classic and will be regarded in the future as a leap in the understanding of our shared humanity&rsquo;s history. Diamond, an American Geographer, spent decades trying to understand why the people of some regions became powerful and advanced, while others were left behind and, eventually, conquered with relative ease. He tries to explain this without any resort to inherent differences between the races, which is doubtful. The idea that race is &ldquo;skin deep&rdquo; has been disproven, there are much deeper differences between the races, as would be expected. If humans in Europe evolved into a lighter skin to absorb more Vitamin D, something minor as seen from the fact that blacks can survive in cold climates, they would necessarily, as they did, also evolve in the most critical component of any human&rsquo;s survival kit, their brains, and the same goes for Blacks, Asians, Arabs, native Americans. Our genetic diversity is a treasure just like any other legacy of our ancestors, it evolved to deal with localized adversities, but the same can be said for our ability to reason, and yet it allows us to tackle issues that go way beyond the struggles of life in the wild. Embracing and better understanding the differences between the races can only do good, as is the nature of true knowledge, and should not be as shunned and looked down upon as it is today. Ignorance and despise of knowledge only leads to destruction and weakness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Diamond did not convince me that environmental differences are the single cause of every difference in today&rsquo;s societies, but the causes he does find are overwhelming in their importance. If the natural constant that 80 of the effects follow from 20 percent of the causes applies to this, which I have no way of confirming, then it seems clear that the differences in initial condition identified by Diamond account for the lion&rsquo;s share of why not all societies developed the same way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Only a thorough reading of his book can give a clear understanding of his thesis, but I&rsquo;ll review some of the most important factors. First, domesticated animals such as pigs, horses, cows and donkeys were extremely important for the civilizations that disposed of them. A zebra, for example, though it is related to horses, can not be domesticated. This difference alone ripples through history greatly: horses were important for warfare until the early 20th century, as well as for general use in activities that required greater than human strength. This means enhanced capacity to fight, to hunt and to produce. Native Americans did not originally possess horses but, upon acquiring them, quickly mastered their use for warfare. Something similar can be said for plant species. Food staples such as wheat, rice and corn, which have been important for human sustenance for thousands of years, were first to be found in the wild. They had to be first identified, then cultivated. The wealth and abundance this generated for the people that had access to them correlates directly to the early civilizations that followed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Another important factor was the capability to reap the benefits of inventions from other regions. In this regard, it would be greatly advantageous to be in Eurasia, where you could trade with many other peoples and exchange goods, mutually enhancing each other&rsquo;s strength and survival capabilities. If instead you&rsquo;re isolated in Australia, the Amazon Forest, or sub-saharan Africa, you&rsquo;ll be significantly worse off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Finally, you have the influence of disease. Because of their living closely with animals for thousands of years, Eurasians had developed immunity to many diseases which, upon arriving in the New World, wrecked the same havoc they had hundreds of years before, in the Old. This happened in the entirety of the Americas, right as the Europeans arrived. Had this factor been left out, it is uncertain that the European powers could ever have dominated the mighty peoples of the Americas so easily, and world history from the 16th century on would be radically different to an extent we can&rsquo;t possibly imagine today. No modern country in the American continent would exist, not one of them, and in their place something very different would stand today. We will never know what.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>In conclusion, it is proper and fair for the son of a successful man to be proud of his father&rsquo;s achievement. Surviving through the darkness of early humanity up to the limitless possibilities of the 21th century was as difficult, and required as much strength, cunning, intelligence, practice and hard work as any achievement of widely admired individuals today. We honor and admire soldiers today, but there was a time when every man was a soldier in a daily war against oblivion. Every living person descends from these brave men, because weakness sows no fields and bears no fruits.</span></p><h1 class="c0 c4 c13"><a id="h.p4ckh4875w65" name="h.p4ckh4875w65"></a></h1><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c0 c4 c13"><a id="h.euh9bvpp4lkz" name="h.euh9bvpp4lkz"></a></h1><h1 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.qnoy2cm2y2a0" name="h.qnoy2cm2y2a0"></a><span>The World We Inherited</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>Below you will find the familiar image of the planet.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><a href="#" id="0f9f2e9a2377dd0e1070ff163e6e878e0612551e" name="0f9f2e9a2377dd0e1070ff163e6e878e0612551e"></a><a href="#" id="3" name="3"></a><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="c17"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 609.00px; height: 304.00px;"><img alt="MODIS_Map.jpg" src="images/image02.jpg" style="width: 609.00px; height: 304.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span>Source: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MODIS_Map.jpg&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1453847062657000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1N8N3XzG8tRgLqOgf9ElBQG_iQw">Wikicommons</a></span><span class="c6">.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span class="c6">Satellite composite image of the planet.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Of course, it is not actually like that.

Mountains, lakes, rivers are some of them. Others are more obscure, such as glaciers, mesas and peninsulas. We will briefly review the most important geographical formations below. I have tried to dot the description with interesting and revealing additional information, so that even if you have a clear idea of, for example, what a river is, you may hopefully still learn something new.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.qwn6jebwlhb9" name="h.qwn6jebwlhb9"></a><span>Mountains and volcanoes</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>A volcano is a type of mountain, as in &quot;large and tall landforms&quot;, and both result from tectonic plate movement. Non-volcanic mountains are elevated masses of rock. Most are part of mountain chains, large elevated areas between tectonic plates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Tectonic plate movement is the most powerful force shaping the planet. Where tectonic plates clash, either one or both of them climb, expelling underground material. If the tectonic plates move away from each other, leaving the underground unexposed, the same happens. The volcano is the conduit of this exposure. One volcanic eruption may expel magma, volcanic ash, gases or combinations of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>In the year 62, there was a powerful earthquake in the Italian Peninsula, around the Apennines mountain chain, in the western shore of the Italian Peninsula. Another happened in 64, while the Roman Emperor Nero performed in a public theater. He kept singing through the earthquake. The theater collapsed soon after it was evacuated. The people of the region were accustomed to them. Other earthquakes happened four four days in 79, but were similarly not cause for great concern. On the fifth day, Mount Vesuvius, part of the Apennines, started erupting, lasting for two days. It was one of the most devastating volcanic eruptions in history, equating a hundred thousand times the heat of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. Herculaneum and Pompeii took the brunt of the damage and were completely destroyed, an archeological treasure for the modern times. The ash covered the cities, burning people alive or suffocating them with ash.</span></p><a href="#" id="60814431271be1a6b67d97edd54288d6dd09b624" name="60814431271be1a6b67d97edd54288d6dd09b624"></a><a href="#" id="4" name="4"></a><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="c17"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0 c26"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 376.00px;"><img alt="1200px-Mt_Vesuvius_79_AD_eruption_3.svg.png" src="images/image01.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 376.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span>Source: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mt_Vesuvius_79_AD_eruption_3.svg&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1453847062665000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGC8VOesbsfeP3LI9URZdodEMt14A">Wikipedia</a></span><span class="c6">.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span>The black shade shows the area affected.

There is no universal height when a hill becomes a mountain. In practice, however, it is easy enough to spot the difference, because they are shorter and less steep. Hills may come from tectonic plate movement, but more often it&#39;s by accumulation from erosion. Rains, rivers, glaciers or wind can be the ultimate cause.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.vpslg5ovjhke" name="h.vpslg5ovjhke"></a><span>Mesas</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>There is one last elevated formation on the comic: mesas. The word means &ldquo;table&rdquo;, which is descriptive enough. They originate from erosion of the top part of hills and mountains.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.o693n6u14s7y" name="h.o693n6u14s7y"></a><span>Lakes</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Now notice the lake on the right side of the volcano on the map. That might be coincidence, but it makes perfect sense. That might be a crater lake, created when volcanoes cause the ground around them to sink. Once the crater is set, a water source can fill it up with water. In the comic, there are two rivers streaming into the pictured lake. In a similar way, some volcanoes create a lake surrounding them, called &ldquo;volcanic lakes&rdquo;. There are many other ways for a lake to form, but the most common would be simple accumulation of water in a depressed area. The depression itself would result from the area around it rising. Below is a photograph of Moraine Lake, in Canada, where a landslide blocked the path of a river, causing it to accumulate. This sets it apart from most lakes of the region, which are the result of melting glaciers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>And because lakes are so pretty, here goes another one, Loughrigg Tarn in England, picture of the day on Wikipedia in June 21, 2015.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.duemyi9h7g1w" name="h.duemyi9h7g1w"></a><span>Glaciers</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Speaking of glaciers, you can see one in the comic. They are accumulations of ice on top of mountains due to the cold weather on high altitudes. The cold weather is a result of less atmospheric pressure, which leads to less air, meaning less matter to gather heat from the Sun. Glaciers are massive and kept in constant movement due to the weight of ever accumulating snow. They partially melt in the warm months, giving rise to rivers that increase discharge in the summer.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.dizwezb69sxf" name="h.dizwezb69sxf"></a><span>Rivers</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>We move on to rivers. There are two sources for free-flowing surface water: melting glaciers and water springs. Both are present in the comic. Water springs do not have a constant discharge, varying according to rainfall. The rainwater then flows through the ground and becomes trapped in cave systems. Some may dry up completely in the low-rainfall season. Hot water springs also exist, with water pumped from underground by volcanic activity. Below you will see an example of a water spring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>A drainage basin or catchment area is the area drained by a river. All humidity in that area flows into the river, be it originated from rainfall, tributary rivers or glaciers. In the comic, that would be the mountain range, as well as the area surrounding the tributary rivers and the main river itself. The forest area is not part of the drainage basin, as it seems to feed on rainfall from the Ocean humidity. This same humidity stops at the mountain range, giving origin to the desert. In the comic, two rivers flow into a lake, which then flows into the main river, which flows into the Ocean. This is also common.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.5oxx5ah4kvc" name="h.5oxx5ah4kvc"></a><span>Deltas and Estuaries</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Upon reaching the ocean, a river might form a delta or an estuary. Though you will find those terms used without discretion as if interchangeable, there is a difference. Deltas are triangular shapes, as the river spreads on many smaller streams closer to the coast. They are fertile, because this river formation distributes its nutrient-rich sediment around. In estuaries, by contrast, rivers reach the ocean with more momentum. They drop straight into the ocean, affecting the landscape to a lesser degree.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.9iwg0dl83six" name="h.9iwg0dl83six"></a><span>Biomes</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Biomes are areas with similar conditions of climate, fauna and flora. A more popularized name for biome would be &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo;. The whole planet is an ecosystem, as in a balanced ecological system, but regions may have a separate balance of their own. The interdependence between different elements may be surprising. Some trees are essential to their whole ecosystem, meanwhile being dependent on certain animals. At the same time, all are dependent on the climate and on the water cycle. Inside a biome you may have another biome of relative isolation, such as an oasis in a desert, or on mountains. The world climate is in constant change, both from natural and from man-made causes. Biomes expand and contract according to these changes. The three main classes of biomes are forests, plains and deserts. Here is a world map of biomes:</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.u2xb6gisqye4" name="h.u2xb6gisqye4"></a><span>Deserts</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>On the left side of the Mountain Range on the comic, you can see a desert. This also makes good sense, as mountain ranges can block humidity from passing through. Deserts are also caused by equatorial wind belts or by cold currents. The former are warms winds which do not drop humidity; this is the case of the Sahara Desert. The latter cause moist winds to rain before they reach land; this is the cause of the Atacama Desert, pictured below.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.tjwz32mawmse" name="h.tjwz32mawmse"></a><span>Plains</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Next, we have plains near the mountain range and on the left side of the mesa in the comic. Plains are flat areas located between elevated areas. In the case of the comic, between the hills and the mountain range, as well as between the volcano and the mesa. When a river runs through a plain, such as we see in the comic, they become river valleys. River valleys are important for agriculture because rivers provide water for irrigation and the flat lands are optimal for farming.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.sp2vf9koi9mm" name="h.sp2vf9koi9mm"></a><span>Forests</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Finally, there&rsquo;s a forest on the coast, on the right side of the mesa. It&rsquo;s difficult to define a forest, but in general they are land covered with trees and other woody vegetation. Depending on climate, there are different kinds of forests - as well as deserts and plains. We will study those in a future chapter. More heat and humidity means the forest can become dense, such as the Amazon Rainforest. In temperate regions, which are colder, less humid and subject to the four seasons, forests are more sparse.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.svruxkbd2re3" name="h.svruxkbd2re3"></a><span>Continents and Oceans</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Continents are large areas of land, while oceans are large areas of water. We tend to picture both as much more far apart than they are in reality. The following two pictures should help disperse that impression:</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.4ni10e3geq65" name="h.4ni10e3geq65"></a><span>Islands</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Islands are areas of land surrounded by water by all sides which are, at the same time, smaller than continents. For example, Australia is a continent, so it would not qualify as an island. A collection of islands somewhat near each other is an archipelago. An island may be inside or bordering a lake, surrounded by a river, an ocean, or combinations thereof. Maraj&oacute; Island, in Northern Brazil, for example, is the largest island surrounded by both the Ocean and a river. Brazil also has the largest river island, Bananal Island.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.hxzgtj9dbhjd" name="h.hxzgtj9dbhjd"></a><span>Seas</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Seas are large bodies of salt water, surrounded in part or completely by land. Thus, a lake is in general called a sea if it consists of salt water. We will review the most important seas in a later chapter. For now, here&rsquo;s a map of the seven seas as understood in Medieval Europe (the meaning has changed over time).</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.nrlh82fkolcq" name="h.nrlh82fkolcq"></a><span>Bays</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Bays are subdivisions of the ocean surrounded from three sides by land, but in a smaller scale than seas. They are important because the surrounding land may block waves and wind, which can make them good areas for ports and fishing. Many coastal cities started on a bay or have nearby bays. A gulf is a larger bay. Here&rsquo;s a bay:</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.6p7nu6bj0by3" name="h.6p7nu6bj0by3"></a><span>Peninsulas</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Peninsulas are the reverse of bays: areas of land surrounded by water on three sides, connected to a larger mainland. On the following image you&rsquo;ll see an example of both a Peninsula and a Gulf (again, larger bays).</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.v2cuad78c2v8" name="h.v2cuad78c2v8"></a><span>Lagoons</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Lagoons are similar to bays in that they are bodies of water surrounded by land on three sides. The difference is that their opening into the larger body of water is either small or further blocked by an island or reef. Here&rsquo;s an example:</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.m9d3owcxrfxh" name="h.m9d3owcxrfxh"></a><span>Atolls</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>By the way, an atoll is a ring-shaped coral reef, which thus surrounds a lagoon, such as:</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.hs0aibpe39ec" name="h.hs0aibpe39ec"></a><span>Straits</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>We&rsquo;re down to the last two: straits and isthmuses. Straits are narrow openings of land from one larger body of water to another, thus in general forming a navigable path. Some straits have been important in history as strategical chokehold points: you control the strait, you control who can pass through it. Here&rsquo;s one example:</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.9maicffm4nj9" name="h.9maicffm4nj9"></a><span>Isthmuses</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>When you need a strait and can&rsquo;t have one, the next best thing is an isthmus: a narrow patch of land between to large bodies of water. They are useful to transport cargo through land from one body of water to the other and they are prime spots for building a canal, which works as an artificial strait. One famous example is the Panama Canal, seen below, which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.4v0kne1hfop3" name="h.4v0kne1hfop3"></a><span>That&rsquo;s it</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>This is as far as we will go, but geographers, geologists, river engineers, captains and other students of navigation will know other formations. Here&rsquo;s a quick example of what else there is out there.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Land formation classification isn&rsquo;t limited to the surface either. Next you will find an example of land formations below sea level.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.1nvqt3msvyp6" name="h.1nvqt3msvyp6"></a><span>On Geography</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Geography, meaning &ldquo;description of the Earth&rdquo;, has been much degraded as a science in our time. The act of drawing maps has completely moved over to Cartography, more a skill than a science. The most technical and in depth description of the Earth has been undertaken by Geology, which is a technical science. The study of the superficial configuration of land falls to Geomorphology, which is essentially part of Geography, and also a technical science, but clearly subservient to Geology as well. The unique part of Geography today would be Human Geography, which has described itself in the 20th century as the study of &ldquo;space&rdquo;, a concept meaning the configuration of human presence on the face of the Earth. Though this is a valid area of study, geographers have also here fallen behind other sciences, and the origin of this might be traced back to a fundamental mistake in the concept of space itself or perhaps, in how Geography will go about studying it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>For example, there is Urban Geography. However, the more useful and interesting share of the study of urban development falls under Urbanism, which has become closer to Architecture, a more practical area of study. No matter what principles or decades of study Geography does of urban space, the fact that Geographers won&rsquo;t be called upon to act on the development of cities makes them powerless and ineffectual. An urbanist&rsquo;s or architect&rsquo;s notion of the possibilities of urban arrangement will be much wider, because he is trained to conceive of new possibilities, and more practical, since he is expected to create plans that can be made into reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The same goes for Rural Geography, which is in a particularly sad state, as Geographers, confused with the infusion of technologies into rural space, stupidly declare that there is no more rural space, as it has turned into urban space. This is a complete failure in the understanding of knowledge itself and a blunder that can&rsquo;t possibly be excused. This is of course of little importance, since geographers&rsquo; misconceptions have little, if any, effect on our lives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>And finally, Cultural Geography and Economic Geography are mainly vehicles of propaganda for ideologies originated from even less important sciences, such as Sociology and Anthropology. Geographers that do not adhere to these ideologies have tried to create meaningful and useful uses for their science without adhering to propaganda, but they have fallen short of being useful. As it turns out, you will understand your space better by reading the opinions of classified people with experience of the real world, be they geographers or not. The study of works of academic Geography itself are useless to build this understanding. In contrast, one can&rsquo;t possibly talk about their country&rsquo;s economy intelligently without being updated with the studies of Economics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The aforementioned Jared Diamond, for example, resorts much more to other sciences to achieve his conclusions. Even if you concede that, perhaps, being a geographer means just that: studying many different disciplines and synthesizing them, the truth is that any intelligent person so disposed can achieve this without ever having read a book produced by academic geographers. There are no principles of Geography to be considered, no laws, no intellectual tools to better clarify our understanding of our surroundings. The concept of space itself is useless for this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Something similar happens with military geography, which is today, as it has always been, important in devising military strategy. Again, academic geographical studies are useless for this, as military study and experience is much more important. Knowledge of geographic features and their meaning is thus important, but not knowledge of Geography.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>As Geography slips into irrelevance in all these things, it also mocks and discards the works of 19th century geographers such as Karl Ritter and Paul Vidal de la Blache, regarded as mere justification for nationalistic political ideologies&mdash;that is, according to modern geographers also intended in using the science for the propaganda of their own ideologies. Both Ritter and Vidal de la Blache were important intellectuals of their time and deserve respect as intelligent men looking for the truth, as opposed to vectors of political interests of their nations. Even so, something is off about trying to continue in their tradition. The sort of ideas they tackled simply do not belong in Geography or can be trusted to geographers alone, just as no one consults sociologists on the state of our society or how to shape it&mdash;an immoral project of the highest order, in my opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Most of all, 19th century Geography was the home of one of the greatest thinkers of the time, Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859), a German. The ignorance of his work by geographers is pathetic, but it hardly matters, as his contribution to human understanding goes beyond the discipline. He is simply one of the most important men of his time, who will always be remembered by history.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>And yet, as much as academic Geography is useless, the study of Geography in school is important for children and teenagers. We were all brought kicking and screaming into globalization, and now we face a reality where everything is connected and interdependent. Free trade has always been a good thing throughout human history, as it brings possibilities for mutually beneficial exchanges.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Most human right are a lie, a luxury of these times of abundance, but of the few real human rights there are, free trade is one of the most important. By free trade alone, you can raise yourself from nothing to the highest echelons of society, if only you have the intelligence, as many have had. That doesn&rsquo;t have to be your aim individually, of course, the accumulation of wealth and power does not have to be the goal of every person. The knowledge that it is possible, however, is essential. If a person learns anything from school level Geography, it should be that there is a world beyond their street, their state, their country. There are languages to learn, people to meet and opportunities to take advantage of all over the world. The future will not be built, as the present wasn&rsquo;t, by people who limit their thinking to their immediate surroundings, especially not today. As long as there are people who think of the world a whole, and calibrate their ambitions accordingly, you will be in a disadvantage if you don&rsquo;t have the same forward thinking.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.j09bzdn6xreg" name="h.j09bzdn6xreg"></a><span>On geographical features</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>I once read an article speculating on the evolutionary origin of the sense of beauty. Images of human bodies, both male and female, of babies and children and of food have all been historically considered pleasing to look at and have been subject of countless paintings. The evolutionary meaning of these things are easy to surmise: reproduction, survival. Images of heroic deeds and battles also can be seen to have the same effect of Epic literature, to teach by example and to inspire. Abstract art, such as geometric patterns in muslim mosques, appeals to our love of order and logical arrangement, as well as Architecture. It pleases us to see a building that is solid, logical, graceful and powerful, perhaps we would like to build ourselves to be thus, or to take pleasure from the results of hard work. A painting of a boat can appeal to our wanderlust, our sense of the endless possibility of human experience. Paintings of deformed beings, disease, horror and rotten still life lead to the consideration of death and suffering, two facts of life, and the avoidance of thought in these things is a proof positive of a foolish mind, as they can&rsquo;t be avoided in reality and it is wise to prepare for what is known to be coming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>All these are useful instincts for a man to have, but one main type of beauty is missing: landscapes. One theory the article mentioned, which convinced me, is that it is reassuring to be able to see far ahead. If you&rsquo;re alone in the wild, you will desire at least to be at an advantage point, so you will know of threats in advance. In effect, many cities have been built on high ground, surrounding mountaintop castles. Coastal cities gaze not inward, but to the sea, where coming threats can be spotted from far away, and this view is frequently the most desired.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>At the same time, if you&rsquo;re on higher ground, any attacking force is at a disadvantage. The enemy will arrive tired, you will be rested. Mongol armies used this technique when attacking Europe. They would flee from the European knights to the high ground, where they had previously left an additional supply of horses. As the Europeans reach them, their horses tired, the Mongols had rested horses to counter attack with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>We will see more examples of the influence of geography on military action and history throughout the book.</span></p><h1 class="c0 c4 c13"><a id="h.r292gs5d7gqa" name="h.r292gs5d7gqa"></a></h1><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c0 c4 c13"><a id="h.l7qriyby0e" name="h.l7qriyby0e"></a></h1><h1 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.em18m1s7xloo" name="h.em18m1s7xloo"></a><span>The Oceans</span></h1><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.av96yjolg4ur" name="h.av96yjolg4ur"></a><span>The World Ocean</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The oceans are subdivisions of the huge mass of salty water, the &quot;World Ocean&quot;, that makes up for 71% of Earth&rsquo;s surface area.

The main European sea powers of the time were Spain and Portugal, the latter having named it, &quot;pacific&quot; meaning &quot;peaceful&quot; in Portuguese. There are many islands in the Pacific.

In the 16th century, European explorers were first able to cross it to reach the American continent. Europeans have called it Atlantic, after the Greek Mythology titan that holds the sky on his back, since the 5th century b.C.. It is sometimes called &ldquo;the pond&rdquo;, a small lake, due to the cultural proximity between the United States and Europe. The term &ldquo;Black Atlantic&rdquo; is a reference to the slave trade from Africa to America and the Caribbean.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.kw0n944sih2z" name="h.kw0n944sih2z"></a><span>The Indian Ocean</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Indian Ocean lies between the Atlantic and the Pacific. It borders Africa to the West, the Middle East and Asia to the North, and Australia to the East. 16th century European explorers names it not in reference to the country of India, but to the East Indies. East Indies was the European name for East Asia and South East Asia.

The following Wikipedia animation explains it quite well:</span></p><p class="c0"><span>From now on we will go with the division that results in seven continents. The Australian continent we will call Oceania&mdash;which I will explain later. That leaves us with: North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania and Antarctica. Just to keep in mind just how connected the continents are, take a moment to understand this map:</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.6qofflilssxt" name="h.6qofflilssxt"></a><span>Europe</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Let&rsquo;s start with the supercontinent of Eurasia because it&#39;s the hardest to break down. We begin with the borders between Europe and Asia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Focus on the line dividing blue and light blue, which is the present boundary between Europe and Asia. Now let&#39;s break it down into three. First, the one that cuts through Russia and Kazakhstan, from the Arctic Ocean to the Caspian Sea. Second, cutting through Georgia, Russia and Azerbaijan, from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea. Third, from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, straight through Turkey. All these are cultural borders but also have natural barriers that make good sense.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The first boundary outlines the Ural Mountains, seen below:</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The second spans the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range, seen below:</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The third is the easiest, right on the Bosphorus Strait, the narrowest strait used for navigation on the planet. Europe lays on the western side, Asia, on the eastern side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The other European limits are easier. It goes north from the Arctic Ocean to south, in the Mediterranean Sea. The Atlantic Ocean lies to the west. This also includes the British Isles and Iceland, because of how near they are. Since culture is also a factor, the Mediterranean Islands belonging to European countries are also included.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.kb8cp7c16v8f" name="h.kb8cp7c16v8f"></a><span>Asia</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Moving on to the remaining part of the Eurasian supercontinent, we have Asia, the largest and most populous (currently around 60% of the planet&rsquo;s human population) continent:</span></p><p class="c0"><span>We have seen how Asia borders with Europe, but we have yet another supercontinent to study in a similar way, the Afro-Eurasian supercontinent, since the borders between Asia and Africa are not so clear-cut either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The border between Asia and Africa cuts through Egypt, right in the Isthmus of Suez, which today features a canal leading from the Mediterranean to the Gulf of Suez.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Asia is an extremely diverse continent. Here&rsquo;s a map of the main families of languages spoken in the continent (there are many more than that, in China alone there are 9 families of languages, while India has 780 languages):</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Some of the most important regions of Asia are the Middle East, the Levant, Southeast Asia, Eastern Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, the Caucasus and Central Asia. You will find maps of each of those (some including parts of neighboring continents) in the gallery below. Just be aware none of this is universally accepted and might never be. It&#39;s all just a learning and organization tool.

That&#39;s acceptable, but also confusing, due to the country of Australia. This division also does not include New Zealand, which would then be part of Zealandia, a currently submerged continent. This is even less practical. So &ldquo;Oceania&rdquo;, I believe, is better.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Oceania includes Australia and nearby islands</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.7jm9v7nhhtsp" name="h.7jm9v7nhhtsp"></a><span>Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia (regions)</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The archipelagos on the eastern part of Oceania can be further divided into three regions, according to ethnic and cultural differences, as seen below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>In the archipelagos north of Oceania, we find the countries of Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Because they have a distinct Asian culture and ethnography, they are normally considered part of Southeast Asia. In a strict physical geographical sense, however, they are closer to Oceania. With the addition of these islands, this alternate Oceania would look like this:</span></p><p class="c0"><span>You may want to compare the map above with the first map of Oceania featured further up and notice the region added.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.pkhqno5c15sq" name="h.pkhqno5c15sq"></a><span>Antarctica</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>And for our last continent, we have Antarctica, in the South Pole. The reason why Antarctica is a continent, as opposed to the Arctic, is that it is a frozen mass of land. The Arctic, in the North Pole, is not a continent, but only the frozen Northern Ocean.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Antarctica is not populated, though it does have permanent scientific stations from many countries. Some of these countries claim parts of its territory, but there is no general agreement. However, Antarctica has an important role in the regulation of the climate, which we will study in a future chapter.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.qdfamc9vcjiv" name="h.qdfamc9vcjiv"></a><span>The main seas, straits, isthmuses, peninsulas and bays</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>Most seas are further divisions of the oceans, but the name is also used for large salt-water lakes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>We might as well start with a quick map of the &ldquo;seven seas&rdquo; as they were understood in the Middle Ages.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.hpslx4826e37" name="h.hpslx4826e37"></a><span>The Mediterranean Sea</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The following map of the Mediterranean also includes a few other seas in the region. Let&rsquo;s go through them one by one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The region depicted in the map above has so much history, you could read a thousand books about all the things that happened there. It shows parts of three continents, Europe, Africa and Asia (The Middle East). Three important peninsulas are present. The first is the Iberic Peninsula, in Western Europe, today occupied by Spain and Portugal. The second is the Italian Peninsula, occupied by Italy. Finally, there&rsquo;s the Peloponnesian Peninsula. It&#39;s the mass of land in Southern Greece, just short of being an island, connected to the mainland by the Isthmus of Corinth. There you will find the Greek city of Sparta.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Strait of Gibraltar and the Strait of Dardanelles separate the Mediterranean from the Atlantic and the Sea of Marmara, respectively. The Strait of Bosphorus then separates the Sea of Marmara from the Black Sea.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The power struggle for control of the Mediterranean and surrounding land shaped human history like no other. On the Eastern region of the Mediterranean you will find the Fertile Crescent. That&rsquo;s where agriculture was first developed, and along with it the first human civilizations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The first civilizations started in Mesopotamia, the land seen to the East, between the rivers Euphrates and Tigris. To the West, you have the Nile River, where the ancient Egyptian Empire developed. We will study these rivers in future chapters. Below you will find four maps. The first depicts the colonies of Ancient Greece. The second, the Macedonian Empire, which unified Greece. The third, the Roman Republic, which conquered Macedonia. The fourth, the Roman Empire, which followed the Republic after the power struggle caused by the death of Julius Caesar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>From the maps above it should be clear that the main strategic goal of these early civilizations was to gain control of the Mediterranean. Up to conquest by the Roman Empire, fierce tribes of barbarians occupied most of mainland Europe. South of the Mediterranean there&rsquo;s the natural barrier of the Sahara Desert. To the West, the Atlantic Ocean would still be unnavigable for many centuries. The remaining direction for expansion for these early European civilization was Asia. But there Asian powers such as the Persian Empire were already established, spawning from Mesopotamia and nearby regions. Meanwhile, the three greatest powers in Greece struggled for influence: Sparta, Athens and Thebes. For centuries they were able to keep Persia off Europe&mdash;though betrayed by Thebes, which sided with Persia. Greece would finally conquer Persia under the leadership of Alexander the Great, a Macedonian. Macedonia, a northern peripheric Greek colony, had unified Greece under its rule in the 4th century b.C.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Alexander the Great&rsquo;s death led to disintegration of his Empire. The role was then took by the Romans, who never conquered as far into Asia as Alexander. However, they expanded occupation of Europe and North Africa.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>One of the reasons why Europe fell into the &ldquo;Dark Ages&rdquo; is that it lost its control over the Mediterranean, becoming unable to trade with Asia. Less trade means less wealth. Though Christianity couldn&rsquo;t win back control of Asia for Europe, it did manage to spread through most of Europe. The standard of Civilization it carried had a strong Roman, Macedonian and Greek influence. This is the heritage that differentiates Europe and makes it a separate continent.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Now looking back at the original map of the Mediterranean, we see many different &ldquo;seas&rdquo; and gulfs. They have historical importance of themselves, but are less useful for this study. Take a moment to notice three of them: the Levantine Sea, the Aegean Sea and the Adriatic Sea.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Levantine Sea, East of the Mediterranean, takes its name from the Levant, where today we find Israel. The struggle for control of this region has also had major impact in history, with the added significance of the Holy Land.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In the Aegean Sea we find the Aegean Islands, which includes the important Greek islands of Crete and Rhodes.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.68i9dcvbvkb6" name="h.68i9dcvbvkb6"></a><span>The Adriatic Sea</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Adriatic Sea, with over 1,300 islands, is connected to the Mediterranean Sea by the Strait of Otranto and lays between Italy and the Balkans. The first settlements off the coast of the Adriatic Sea started around 6,000 b.C. Its colonization by the Greeks began in the 7th century b.C.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.arbhxsmu8wz" name="h.arbhxsmu8wz"></a><span>The Sea of Marmara, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Crossing the Strait of Dardanelles we arrive at the Sea of Marmara, which today falls within the borders of Turkey. From the Sea of Marmara, crossing the Strait of Bosphorus, we arrive at the Black Sea, which is itself connected to the Sea of Azov. East of the Black Sea we have the Caucasus region, one of the Asian regions mentioned in the previous chapter. The name of course comes from the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range, also a border between Europe and Asia.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.q6lhzqq7azdh" name="h.q6lhzqq7azdh"></a><span>The Red Sea</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Red Sea, a gulf of the Indian Ocean, lies between Africa and the Middle-East. The Isthmus of Suez separates it from the Mediterranean Sea, a barrier brought down in 1869, the opening year of the Suez Canal. Before that, people carried goods across by land, so the Red Sea has long been a link between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The idea of the canal itself goes back to two thousand years b.C.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.wwa6j4dyzqup" name="h.wwa6j4dyzqup"></a><span>The Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Caspian sea is the final destination of the water carried by the Volga river, the most important river of Russia. That means it is an &ldquo;endorheic&rdquo; drainage basin: unlike most others, it does not discharge into the ocean. How can the Caspian Sea receive the full discharge of the largest river in Europe, as well as 130 others? This is possible because it is so large that its rate of evaporation balances the water input out. In fact, it is so large that, if considered a lake, it would be the largest in the world. To drive home how exceptional this is, remember that most other endorheic basins are deserts. Of the endorheic basins that do have rivers and lakes, the Volga/Caspian is the largest. However, through man-made canals, today the Volga does connect to the Ocean.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Caspian stands in the border between Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Iran and Turkmenistan. The largest city on the Caspian is Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. To the East of the Caspian, lies the Caucasus Mountains; to the west, Central Asia. Rich in oil, it was home to the first offshore oil wells, as well as the first machine-drilled oil well. In the early 20th century, Baku was the center of the oil industry. All this oil production was later administered by the Soviet Union, which captured the territory in 1920.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Nearby Aral Sea does not look today as it did on the map above. Once one of the largest lakes in the world, and also endorheic, it has since dried-up due to use of its rivers for irrigation. The map below shows the shrinking of the Aral Sea up to 2008, but contemporary satellite images shows it even smaller.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>In Mongolian, &quot;Aral&quot; means &quot;island&quot;, referring to the over 1,100 Islands that stood in the Aral Sea.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.yqwi5hwq65gu" name="h.yqwi5hwq65gu"></a><span>The Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Persian Gulf connects to the Gulf of Oman through the Strait of Hormuz. The Gulf of Oman is then linked to the Arabian Sea, which is part of the Indian Ocean. It lies between Iran, to the northeast, and the Arabian Peninsula, to the southwest. The name &ldquo;Persian&rdquo; draws from the territory today occupied by Iran, which is not an Arab country. Even after Arabian conquer, Iranians did not lose their language or their separate identity. Ethnic Persians are still 60% of the Iranian population, and Persian is still its most-used language. Also, Iranians are Shiite Muslims, while most Arab countries have a Sunni Muslim majority. All this to say that some governments of Arab countries call it &quot;Arabian Gulf&quot;.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Gulf of Oman is not a Gulf, but a Strait (as it is not surrounded by water from three sides). It is most often seen as part of the Persian Gulf, not of the Arabian Sea.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.i7wtv1kip59j" name="h.i7wtv1kip59j"></a><span>The Arabian Sea</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Arabian Sea is a stretch of the Indian Ocean, bordering Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Southern Asia. It has been an important trade route since the 3rd millennium b.C.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.11c6wpj4cccz" name="h.11c6wpj4cccz"></a><span>Asian bodies of water</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>We will now review a few Asian bodies of water. Here&#39;s a general map of Asia for reference.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.qskanurldy51" name="h.qskanurldy51"></a><span>The East China Sea</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The East China Sea is part of the Pacific Ocean. It lays east of the Eastern Coast of China, which includes Shanghai, the largest Chinese city. The Yangtze river formed the river delta you see on Shanghai&rsquo;s location. It is the longest river in Asia, the third longest in the world. Another city you see on the Yangtze is Nanjing, which was the capital of China in a few periods of its history. We will further study the Yangtze in a later chapter.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>To the west, it borders two Japanese islands. To the south, it borders the island of Taipei, beyond which lays the South China Sea. To the North, it connects to the Sea of Japan through the Korea Strait.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Chinese know it as the &ldquo;East Sea&rdquo;, one of the &quot;Four Seas&quot;, one for each cardinal direction. The lands &ldquo;within the Four Seas&rdquo; has been a name for China. Of these, we will review the South Sea next. The West Sea is Qinghai Lake, still within the borders of China. Though it is approximately in the center of the Chinese territory, most larger Chinese cities stand East of it. The North Sea is Lake Baikal, today located within Russia, near the southern border with Mongolia.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>There are a few territorial disputes in the East China Sea. The main dispute is between Japan and China on the delineation of their exclusive economic zones (&quot;EEZ&quot;).</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.8wlg24syuiga" name="h.8wlg24syuiga"></a><span>The South China Sea</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The South China Sea, a section of the Pacific Ocean, is home to many territorial disputes, which the map above shows quite well. It lays south of Mainland China (and Taiwan), west of the Philippines, east of Vietnam, north of Brunei and the eastern part of Malaysia. The main source of dispute is the Chinese claim to the &quot;South China Sea Islands&quot;, the green dots on the map. This would result in most of the South China Sea being inside China&rsquo;s &quot;exclusive economic zone&quot;. The problem is, none of those islands have indigenous peoples, only a few have natural water supply, and some are underwater on high tides. However, this area does hold reserves of oil, gas and minerals, as well as sea life exploitable as food.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.i19l8w7z74qk" name="h.i19l8w7z74qk"></a><span>The Yellow Sea</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Yellow Sea is the northern part of the East China Sea, between mainland China and the Korean Peninsula. Its name comes from sand particles carried by sand storms in the Gobi Desert that turn the water yellow. Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, has an outport into the Yellow Sea.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.3b2fc5wugomw" name="h.3b2fc5wugomw"></a><span>The Sea of Japan</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Sea of Japan lays between the Korean Peninsula and Eastern Russia to the west, and Japan to the East. It holds a rich sea life, explored by bordering countries.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.s0s5ykf0yyp5" name="h.s0s5ykf0yyp5"></a><span>The Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Bay of Bengal is the largest bay in the world. It borders India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which belong to India, border it from the East. They also delineate neighboring Andaman Sea. A few rivers flow into the Bay of Bengal. Those include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, two of the most important rivers in India. It holds some of the largest ports in the world, in India and Bangladesh. It gathers particular strategic importance from its position between the Middle East and the Extreme Orient. Both bordering countries and outside powers seek presence in the area.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.2msski6lk8wl" name="h.2msski6lk8wl"></a><span>The Sea of Okhotsk</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Located on Eastern Russia, the Sea of Okhotsk takes its name from the first Russian settlement in the region. During the colder parts of the year, the fresh water coming from the Amur River freezes, creating a barrier around the coast. When this happens, it is difficult or impossible to navigate in the Sea of Okhotsk. The name for this phenomenon is &quot;ice dam&quot; or &quot;ice jam&quot;.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.d8qrno7o8o8s" name="h.d8qrno7o8o8s"></a><span>The Bering Sea</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Bering Sea lies between the Alaska and the Russian Far East, enclosed by the Russian Kamchatka Peninsula. Most scientists believe it was the route for human migration from the Afro-Eurasia to the Americas. It is the site for Red King Crab fishing, the most dangerous job in the United States.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.5ut0vz71b5w6" name="h.5ut0vz71b5w6"></a><span>The Baja California Peninsula and the Gulf of California</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Baja California Peninsula separates the Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of California. At its narrowest, it is 320 Km wide.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.65451b1c6zg1" name="h.65451b1c6zg1"></a><span>The Gulf of Mexico</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Gulf of Mexico borders the Southern United States and the Eastern Coast of Mexico, enclosed by the Florida Peninsula and Cuba.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.bxa9pl5szzzq" name="h.bxa9pl5szzzq"></a><span>The Caribbean Sea</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Caribbean Sea stretches through the Eastern Coast of Central America. The Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula encloses it to the West and the Caribbean Archipelago to the North and East. The largest islands of the Caribbean are Cuba and Hispaniola, home to the Dominican Republic and Haiti. The area receives 12 million tourists yearly, 8 million of them through cruise ships.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.xz4vxbfsyoms" name="h.xz4vxbfsyoms"></a><span>The Hudson Bay</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Hudson Bay lays on Northeastern Canada and is the second largest bay in the world, after the Bay of Bengal. It has been a port for trade since the 17th century, first between Europe and Native-Americans, today between Canada, Europe and Russia. It spends the colder parts of the year frozen. It drains a large area of Canada, as seen below.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.ny6vc4h2aeyr" name="h.ny6vc4h2aeyr"></a><span>The Baltic Sea</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Baltic Sea is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean in Northern Europe, East of the Scandinavian Peninsula, further enclosed by the Danish islands.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.uwg5etkz723i" name="h.uwg5etkz723i"></a><span>The main biomes</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>A biome or ecosystem is an area of similar climatic conditions and similar presence of life. The original life forms in a biome either evolved together or merged together at some moment. Excluding human influence, there is ecological balance between life population, geographical formations and climate. Introduced species may disturb this balance, but not always. In a similar way, humans may coexist without disturbing the ecosystem. The degree of disturbance varies according to culture and population size.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Biomes follow from the climate found in the region. Below you will find a graph showing the biomes formed according to annual rainfall and average temperature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Holdridge life zones system is another scheme to visualize biomes, more detailed than the graph above. It is quite more complex, but it pays off to take a minute to understand its meaning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Below you will find an extraordinary vegetation world map from Wikipedia. We will use it as a guide and go through each biome from top to bottom.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.kjme9swp44v9" name="h.kjme9swp44v9"></a><span>Polar Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Polar deserts have low precipitation and a mean temperature, during summer, of less than 10&deg;C. We find polar deserts near Earth&rsquo;s North and South Pole. Antarctica is not included in the Vegetation Map above, but most of its area would fall under this classification.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.w6tj9idrm0ie" name="h.w6tj9idrm0ie"></a><span>Tundra</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Tundra forms in areas where the extreme cold and short summers do not allow for tree growth. Unlike in polar deserts, in Tundras you will find small plants such as shrub, grass and moss, as well as lichen. This stark environment does not allow an abundance of animal life, but birds do migrate to tundras for water. There are three types of tundra: Arctic, Alpine and Antarctic. Alpine Tundra forms where high altitudes create an environment akin to the polar environment.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.bmq9r3w8ce4h" name="h.bmq9r3w8ce4h"></a><span>Taiga</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>As we move further south from the poles, conifers are the first kind of trees we will find. Taigas are the zone marked by their presence alone among trees. Their leaves are long and thin, some are scale-like, and they are not shed before winter. Conservation of energy is key to survive with little sunlight. Conifers&rsquo; leaves do not provide enough nutrients for most animals, but taigas do have more animal life than tundras.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.ijfzc4x9qo5o" name="h.ijfzc4x9qo5o"></a><span>Temperate Broadleaf Forest</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Moving further south, as days and summers become longer, it is important for trees to be able to capture the extra sunlight. For this, they need broad leaves, unlike the hard, needle-like conifer leaves. But these broad leaves cannot withstand winter. For this reason, deciduous trees suck back the nutrients from the leaves, then shed them. This is why they lose the green color. Animal life becomes richer as leaves are more edible.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.wra9184b37s1" name="h.wra9184b37s1"></a><span>Temperate Steppe</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Going further south, we find Steppe where there isn&rsquo;t enough water to sustain trees. In these areas we find grasses and shrubs. Temperature variation is great. Between summer and winter, because of proximity to the poles. Between day and night, because low air humidity doesn&rsquo;t allow for heat retention.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.50roj4x98r6g" name="h.50roj4x98r6g"></a><span>Subtropical Rainforest</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Subtropical rainforests enjoy larger precipitation than the previous biomes. Limitations such as short summers and low sunlight are also absent. This allows for more richness of both plant and animal life. Many of the species found on subtropical rainforests are the same found in tropical rainforests. The difference is that less precipitation and lower temperatures make their presence more sparse.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.rbohjjcrt3pi" name="h.rbohjjcrt3pi"></a><span>Mediterranean Vegetation</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>In the Mediterranean we find scrubby but dense vegetation, broad-leaves shrubs, bushes and small trees. These are characteristic of hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Most rainfall happens during winters. There are summer storms, but in general it is subject to many dry months. Mediterranean plant life does not shed leaves before winter - meaning, they are &ldquo;evergreen&rdquo;.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.h2dgqcardqon" name="h.h2dgqcardqon"></a><span>Monsoon Forest</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Monsoon forests are characteristic of areas subject to monsoon rains, which we will review in a later chapter. These areas have a long dry season followed by a season of heavy rainfall. Some plants shed their leaves during the dry season. We find this biome in Southeast Asia and one typical plant is the bamboo.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.igqc5b4b1vir" name="h.igqc5b4b1vir"></a><span>Arid Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Arid regions have a severe lack of humidity, which in turn causes a lack of nutrients, preventing animal and plant life. Because air humidity is low, there are extreme variations in temperature between night and day. Coupled with the lack of plant life to protect the soil, this results in further degradation of rock and nutrients. Nearby mountain ranges are the ultimate cause for some deserts, as they force clouds upwards. In these cases, rain falls on one side of the mountain chain, but not on the other, which then becomes a desert.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Water presence, such as from a passing river carrying nutrient-rich sediment, eases this condition. Oases are another source of water, resulting from springs and outflows of underground water. The result is vegetation and animal life present in the margins of rivers or oases.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.i18tmiehh79o" name="h.i18tmiehh79o"></a><span>Xeric Shrublands</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>As we move away from deserts into more moisture-rich regions, plant life begins to return. Xeric Shrublands are this transition zone. It supports tough and small vegetation, shrubs, which are able to survive with low humidity. Some animal life is present, such as reptiles. Xeric Shrublands are fragile and turn desertic with disruption.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.vykzjuo38hjq" name="h.vykzjuo38hjq"></a><span>Dry Steppe</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>In a past section we saw Temperate Steppe. The Dry Steppe is similar, but drier, closer to a desert. In practice, it is difficult to distinguish between the two kinds and even between them and Xeric Shrublands. You will find all three referred to simply as steppes, for example.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.brz7c37sie2u" name="h.brz7c37sie2u"></a><span>Semi-Arid Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Also referred to as steppe sometimes. Semi-deserts are mild deserts, with less temperature variation and higher humidity. For this reason, the soil is not as degraded as explained before. They form in the transition between deserts and more humid areas.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.6tip4ptgk5tw" name="h.6tip4ptgk5tw"></a><span>Grass Savanna</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>We find Savannas in regions where the soil is able to sustain forests, but the climate is not humid enough. For this reason, they are fluid and expand or contract according to the conditions found. For example, deforestation of the Amazon Forest in Brazil gives place to &ldquo;cerrado&rdquo;, a type of savanna. This deforestation might be man-made, but it may also caused by natural climate fluctuation. A strong rainy season might expand the Amazon Forest and contract the cerrado, for example.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.f56s41owlt7f" name="h.f56s41owlt7f"></a><span>Tree Savanna</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Tree Savannas are of course alike grass savannas, the difference being the presence of trees. This can follow from soil profile. The afore-mentioned cerrado itself has two types: cerrado stricto sensu and cerrado dense. The latter is closer to a grass savanna, while the second is closer to a tree savanna. Though savannas are more open spaces than trees, the tree numbers might be similar. The difference is, higher humidity in forests allow trees to be larger, wider, and as a result their canopy cover a larger area.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.vj0bgw20mayi" name="h.vj0bgw20mayi"></a><span>Subtropical Dry Forest</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Tropical Dry Forests populated areas where, though having a strong rainy season, also sport long dry seasons. Some tree species will shed leaves before the dry season, if they do not have a nearby source of water. As the trees shed leaves, they allow the sunlight to reach the ground, causing grass to grow. This would not happen in a Tropical Rainforest such as the Amazon, where barely any light reaches the soil.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.3mxkz5nwuu3c" name="h.3mxkz5nwuu3c"></a><span>Tropical Rainforest</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Around the Equator, sunlight is abundant and always present. If precipitation is also supplied year-round, a tropical rainforest forms. There is no need for any shedding of leaves, as there is no dry nor cold season. The climate is always hot, always wet. Plant cover is overwhelming, only around 2% of sunlight reaches the soil. See the photo below for an example.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>You might not have a correct impression of a rainforest from watching movies. Traversing a rainforest is difficult, as plants stand close to each other. Dead leaves and other plant material, as well as roots, cover the soil. The temperature is high, there is no wind. You can&rsquo;t see too far ahead because of all the plants blocking your view. To pass through a virgin rainforest, you need to carry some kind of blade and hack through as you go. They cover some of the hardest areas to explore in the planet, reason why they are sparsely populated and largely unknown.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.by84hqvcjd98" name="h.by84hqvcjd98"></a><span>Alpine Tundra</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Alpine Tundras form in high altitudes, where it is too cold and winds are too strong to sustain trees. As a result, grass cover is dominant.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.v1kio11ygozh" name="h.v1kio11ygozh"></a><span>Montane Forest</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Montane Forests form in moderate elevations, not harsh enough to force an Alpine Tundra.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.xt8xqekomyjx" name="h.xt8xqekomyjx"></a><span>The main rivers</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>Rivers are essential to the understanding of human civilization and colonization of the planet. They are useful as a source of freshwater, transport and irrigation. Most exploration of the planet followed courses of rivers and when not present, human presence is small or absent. In history, rivers have been both pathways of war and natural barriers used in strategy. It&rsquo;s no wonder many national borders follow the courses of rivers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The end result is that many major regional divisions of the planet follow from rivers. In turn, Regions are important for understanding the planet and a building block of Geography. For this reason, we will save the study of most rivers for the later part of the course, after this general introduction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>In this chapter, we will review only the longest and most important rivers. In future chapters, we will delve deeper on them and the life that formed around them.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.am5uzrxr60ku" name="h.am5uzrxr60ku"></a><span>The Rivers of the Fertile Crescent</span></h2><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.1rs0mrdesioh" name="h.1rs0mrdesioh"></a><span>The Tigris and the Euphrates</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Mesopotamia means &quot;land between rivers&quot;.

It passes by 11 countries, with two main courses. The Blue Nile starts in Ethiopia, the White Nile, in Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa. Upon joining together, near Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, they become The Nile. The river crosses through the Sahara Desert and then reaches Egypt.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.kwbrpdo7nm35" name="h.kwbrpdo7nm35"></a><span>European Rivers</span></h2><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.ctytc1l3uzau" name="h.ctytc1l3uzau"></a><span>The Rh&ocirc;ne</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Rh&ocirc;ne rises in Switzerland, passes through Lake Geneva, then flows into the Mediterranean in France.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.1jhxhqhn71b6" name="h.1jhxhqhn71b6"></a><span>The Loire</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Loire flows completely inside France into the Atlantic Ocean.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.ybbfrpr6ph6i" name="h.ybbfrpr6ph6i"></a><span>The Seine</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Seine flows in Northern France, passing through Paris.

It flows through the Congo Rainforest, the second largest in the world after the Amazon Rainforest. It passes by 10 African countries, but for most of its course it flows through the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.ymldb1ryhqme" name="h.ymldb1ryhqme"></a><span>The Niger</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Niger rises in Guinea, then passing by Mali, Niger, Benin and Nigeria, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean. Other than the large delta it forms at the end of its course, it also forms an inland delta in Mali. The Inner Niger Delta is a series of streams, marshes and lakes, conducive to both fishing and agriculture. It is interesting in that it starts only 240 km from the coast, but then runs north through the Sahara Desert, returning in a crescent shape to the Ocean.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.zj7h1wapsts" name="h.zj7h1wapsts"></a><span>The Zambezi</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Zambezi rises in Zambia, flowing through Angola, Namibia, Botswana and finally Mozambique, where it empties into the Indian Ocean.

Its drainage basin is also the largest in the world. The Amazon Rainforest surrounds it, also the largest in the world. It isn&rsquo;t clear whether it is longer than the Nile, which would make it the longest river in the world as well. The Amazon starts from a confluence of minor streams in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, then entering Brazil.

There are four classifications of deserts: hot, cold, semi arid and coastal.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The understanding of the function of water in the environment is important to explain hot deserts. As explained in an earlier chapter, water functions as a carrier of temperature in nature. In rainforests, nights tend not to be much colder than days for this reason. In hot deserts, because there is little cloud cover during the day, days are hotter than in others environments. Come night, all this heat dissipates for lack of humidity, and it becomes much colder. This great variation of temperature in one day-cycle further degrades rocks. Because this condition has been present for a long time, it has had lasting effect upon the soil and the presence of life. Animals and plants that can survive with little humidity might be present. A topical presence of water form micro-environments, but it cannot have effect over large areas. This is the case of oases and passing rivers.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Cold deserts are dry because the air is too cold, so there is no evaporation of snow cover. The little precipitation they get fall in the form of snow and accumulates with the snow cover in a similar way to sand. The snow forms dunes and blizzards like sand dunes and sand storms in arid deserts.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Semiarid deserts form in the transition between deserts and other biomes, as the humidity rises. As we have seen in the biomes chapter, there are many different kinds. They may have short rainy seasons that are not enough to change the landscape from a desert to another biome.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Coastal deserts are sometimes long and thin, following along a coast and a mountain range. As explained before, the mountains force clouds upwards, causing them to rain, but only on one side. Besides losing humidity, these air currents also lose heat as they move upwards. For this reason, these deserts are also colder and have lower temperature variation in the day-cycle.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>We will now review all deserts in the &quot;List of deserts by area&quot; wikipedia article.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.pl75vva5qw9t" name="h.pl75vva5qw9t"></a><span>Antarctica</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Most of mainland Antarctica is a cold or polar desert. When precipitation occurs, it&rsquo;s in the form of snow, which accumulates on top of more snow cover. Because snow is white and reflective, it reflects the sunlight, further diminishing heat absorption. Since the snow doesn&rsquo;t melt or evaporate, the air is also kept dry. Few vegetation other than mosses and fungi are present, and more towards the coast.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Inside the Antarctic Polar Desert we find the snow-free McMurdo Dry Valleys, one of the most extreme deserts on Earth. See a map and a photograph below.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.4jrznweuh95o" name="h.4jrznweuh95o"></a><span>Sahara</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Sahara is the largest hot desert in the world. It borders the Mediterranean biome to the North, the Atlantic Ocean to the West and the Red Sea to the East. South of the Sahara lies the Sahel, a semi-arid transition zone, picture below.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.fe6hbvqsxv1o" name="h.fe6hbvqsxv1o"></a><span>The Arabian Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Arabian Desert covers much of the Arabian Peninsula. At the core of the Arabian Desert lies the Rub&rsquo; al Khali, the largest sand desert in the world, pictured below.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.yif3vvot1b5v" name="h.yif3vvot1b5v"></a><span>The Gobi Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Gobi Desert is the largest desert in Asia. It stretches from Mongolia to Southern China. It is the product of the rain shadow created by the Himalaya mountain range, which blocks rain clouds from the Indian Ocean. This was the land crossed by the Silk Road and ruled by Genghis Khan.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.2xcpsfah2hmm" name="h.2xcpsfah2hmm"></a><span>Kalahari Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Kalahari is a semi-arid desert, enjoying a short rainy season. For this reason, it supports more plant and animal life than the deserts mentioned above. It is the theatre of one of the great animal migrations on the planet, featuring zebras, wildebeest, lions, cheetahs, leopards, wild dogs, hyenas and others. They follow the summer rains, when the desert turns into a large green oasis overnight.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.rt2ggo4iw9ua" name="h.rt2ggo4iw9ua"></a><span>Patagonian Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Patagonian Desert, or Patagonian Steppe, borders the Andes mountain chain to the West and the Atlantic Ocean to the East. It is semi-arid in the north, but with a core of shrubby and herbaceous vegetation. It is the product of the rain shadow from the Andes.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.n8obok9wk5gu" name="h.n8obok9wk5gu"></a><span>Australian Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The next desert in the list is the Great Victorian Desert, in Australia, but here we break off from the list and review all the Australian deserts at once.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The largest of them is the Great Victorian Desert, which features grasslands, shrublands and salt lakes. Rainfall is irregular but larger than in the previous deserts.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Great Sandy Desert is the second largest Australian desert. It is arid enough to contain sand dunes (ergs). Precipitation is is also larger relative to other deserts, but dependent on irregular Monsoon patterns. In the summer, it features some of the highest temperatures in Australia and Wolfe Creek, a famous meteorite impact crater, pictured below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Gibson Desert includes thin grasses, sand plains, dune fields and several saltwater lakes.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Simpson Desert features dry, red sand and is the largest sand dune desert in the world. Under the soil runs the Great Artesian Basin, which naturally springs into the surface in several places.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.4va85c9mtwio" name="h.4va85c9mtwio"></a><span>Syrian Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Syrian desert is rocky and flat, lying south of Mesopotamia. In parts it is a steppe, in others, a harsher desert.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.h0yo4wkwbhj" name="h.h0yo4wkwbhj"></a><span>Great Basin Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Great Basin Desert is a coastal desert affected by a rain shadow created by the Sierra Nevada mountain range to the West. To the East, it borders the Rocky Mountains. North, lie the Mojave Desert and the Sonoran Desert.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.jmdxqvs1p2bp" name="h.jmdxqvs1p2bp"></a><span>Chihuahuan Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Chihuahuan Desert stretches across most of the border between the United States and Mexico. It is also a product of rain shadow: the Sierra Madre Occidental blocks humidity from the Pacific Ocean and the Sierra Madre Oriental, from the Gulf of Mexico. The desert itself is home to several mountain ranges, you will find a sample below.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.ouo5y3o6wqb0" name="h.ouo5y3o6wqb0"></a><span>Karakum Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Karakum Desert lies east of the Caspian Sea and south of the Aral Sea, covering 70% of the territory of Turkmenistan. As the Aral Sea contracts, as mentioned in a previous chapter, the Karakum Desert expands to where it lied. It is home to the famous &quot;Door to Hell&quot;, a natural gas field that has been burning without interruption since discovered in 1971.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.cm97i45288mv" name="h.cm97i45288mv"></a><span>Colorado Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Colorado Plateau is a desertic region in the American states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Arizona. It features scattered, isolated forests, and the Grand Canyon, shown earlier. It has the greatest concentration of National Parks Service units in the country.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.irj72ev0zms0" name="h.irj72ev0zms0"></a><span>Sonoran Desert and Mojave Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Here again we break from the list to show the Sonoran Desert and the Mojave Desert together. While the Sonoran Desert covers part of the US-Mexico border, the Mojave lies north, within the US territory.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Sonoran wraps in part the Gulf of California. It is one of the most frequent routes for illegal immigrants from Mexico to the US.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Mojave Desert is a coastal desert, cut-off from humidity by the Tehachapi Mountains. The largest city in the Mojave is Las Vegas, Nevada.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.o5adxqehgqc3" name="h.o5adxqehgqc3"></a><span>Kyzyl Kum</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Kyzyl Kum is a desert in Central Asia, spanning the territories of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Sand dunes cover most of its area, but there is land proper for agriculture around rivers and oases.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.nqfxp5sgc0l1" name="h.nqfxp5sgc0l1"></a><span>Taklamakan Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Taklamakan Desert is an Asian desert surrounded by mountains from the south, west and north, and the Gobi Desert from the East. Sand dunes cover 85% of the Taklamakan and it spans parts of China, Pakistan and India. Also a pathway of the Silk Road, caravans would stop at oasis towns for relief.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.dwnbg5rn9wbq" name="h.dwnbg5rn9wbq"></a><span>Thar Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Thar Desert or Great Indian Desert forms a natural boundary between India and Pakistan. Shifting sand dunes cover most of its area, with a handful of saltwater lakes. It covers the area where flowed the Sarasvati River, mentioned in an earlier chapter.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.i3s62tz4yxfi" name="h.i3s62tz4yxfi"></a><span>Atacama Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Atacama Desert is the driest non-polar desert in the world. Stony terrain covers most of its area, with a presence of salt lakes and sand. The Chilean territory holds most of the desert&rsquo;s core, but the surrounding transition zone includes parts of Peru, Bolivia and Argentina. The Chilean Coastal Range to the West and the Andes keep the Atacama in a permanent rain shadow. Because of low air humidity, inexistent cloud cover and high altitude, it is one of the best places in the world for astronomical observation.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.gi7m2yn8fwkg" name="h.gi7m2yn8fwkg"></a><span>Namib Desert</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Namib Desert is coastal desert in southern Africa, north of the Kalahari. From the East, the Drakensberg mountains keep moist clouds originated in the Indian Ocean from passing through. Humid air coming from the Atlantic Ocean, west of the desert, turn into fog by contact with warm dry winds coming from the East. As a result, the coastal area of the desert may experience up to 180 days of thick fog a year. Though a navigational hazard responsible for many sunk ships, the moisture is essential for desert life. As a result, the Namib is one of the driest deserts, and with the least precipitation. Most passing by rivers either dry up in the summer or vanish into the desert and there are no lakes. Some scientists believe it is the oldest desert in the world: between 55 and 80 million years old.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.cupfutxae8bc" name="h.cupfutxae8bc"></a><span>Dasht-e Kavir</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Dasht-e Kavir, or Great Salt Desert, is a desert in Iran. It receives little rain and snow each year, but there marshes, seasonal lakes and season river beds. Affected by extreme temperatures, they dry, leaving behind large crusts of salt. Human presence is sparse and limited to oases.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.yx1ryk51d4jm" name="h.yx1ryk51d4jm"></a><span>Dasht-e Lut</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Dasht-e Lut, or Lut Desert, is also a large salt desert in Iran, south-east of the Dasht-e Kavir. It is one of Earth&rsquo;s driest and hottest places.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.km905gmc4zsa" name="h.km905gmc4zsa"></a><span>Forest types and distribution</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>Due to the connection between forests and biomes, here&rsquo;s the biome world map again for reference:</span></p><p class="c0"><span>A forest is a large area covered with trees or other woody vegetation. They make up for 26% of the world&rsquo;s land area and contain 80% of the planet&rsquo;s plant biomass. Different kinds of forest form in different parts of the world for a variety of reasons. In general, there are different kinds when nearer the poles, near the tropics and near the Equator. There are also variations according to altitude. Their size can vary with climate variations, introduction of foreign plant species and human influence. Natural fires and parasites may also contribute to shrinkage of forest area. Difficulty of human settlement or administrative decision might protect them from degradation. They can be set aside for hunting, logging, city climate control and tourism or general aesthetic enjoyment.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>There are many proposed classifications for forests. We will use the one used by the The UN&rsquo;s Environment Programme&rsquo;s World Conservation Monitoring Centre. That leaves us at:</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><ul class="c1 lst-kix_ok7v74utxly5-0 start"><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>Temperate needleleaf;</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>Temperate broadleaf and mixed;</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>Tropical moist;</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>Sparse trees and parkland;</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>Forest plantations.</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span>Let&rsquo;s go through each of those giving examples.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.u08plbhzuf9w" name="h.u08plbhzuf9w"></a><span>Temperate Needleleaf</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>We know Temperate Needleleaf forests from the Taiga and the Montane Forest biomes. Coniferous trees are not only the dominant plant life, but in some cases the only present. We find Temperate Needleleaf forests in the Northern Hemisphere.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.8vt23l4mlurh" name="h.8vt23l4mlurh"></a><span>Temperate Broadleaf and mixed</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>We find Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed forests both in the North and the Southern Hemisphere. We know it from the &ldquo;Temperate Broadleaf Forest&rdquo; biome. In the Northern Hemisphere, these forests form as, moving further south, broadleaf trees become possible. Because needleleaf forests are also present, they earn the &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; epithet.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In the Southern Hemisphere, there are no Temperate Needleleaf forests. There, coniferous trees are always found accompanied by their broadleaf counterparts. Some of the countries with forests of this kind are: United States, China, Japan, Chile, Tasmania, Australia, New Zealand. They are also present in the Mediterranean region.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.65wafurtu0f8" name="h.65wafurtu0f8"></a><span>Tropical Moist</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Tropical Moist includes the Subtropical and Tropical Rainforest biomes. It also includes flooded forests and swamps. In Brazil, two kinds draw special interest: v&aacute;rzea and cant&atilde;o, on the course of large rivers in flat lands, flooded in the rainy season.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The &quot;peat&quot; in Peat Swamp comes from the accumulation of dead plant matter on the ground. This happens because the biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition. The accumulation of peat is one of the largest carbon dumps in the planet.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.f9obebigtbr2" name="h.f9obebigtbr2"></a><span>Tropical Dry</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Tropical and Subtropical Dry forests are forests in the tropics affected by seasonal drought. This includes the Monsoon, Tree Savanna and Subtropical Dry Forest biomes. In most of these forests, trees tend to lose their leaves before the dry season.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.x0xhed3r0pq5" name="h.x0xhed3r0pq5"></a><span>Sparse trees and parkland</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Sparse trees and parkland are transition zones between forest and non-forested areas. One example is the area between tundras and taigas, where trees are present, but not in large numbers. As a result, tree canopy cover is between 10% and 30%. There is high presence of bryophytes, such as mosses.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.esi1zrnxz2c7" name="h.esi1zrnxz2c7"></a><span>Forest plantations</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Forest plantations are man-made forests of rapid-growing timber trees for seasonal logging. Though poor in biodiversity, they are important, if for nothing else, to ease pressure for logging natural forests.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.fctc7i16ts6c" name="h.fctc7i16ts6c"></a><span>Tectonic plates and types of mountains and volcanoes</span></h1><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.kyqrl9pujbde" name="h.kyqrl9pujbde"></a><span>Tectonic plates</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Again, tectonic plate movement is the most powerful force shaping the planet. The map below shows where the tectonic plates are and in what direction they move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The first thing to notice is that some are converging&mdash;moving closer&mdash;and others diverging&mdash;moving apart.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.1jkl9qgpl8nn" name="h.1jkl9qgpl8nn"></a><span>Diverging tectonic plates</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>If you search the map for diverging tectonic plates, you will see most diverging areas are under the sea, except for Iceland. The geology of Iceland is unique that way and, as a result, it contains more than 30 active volcanoes and geysers.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Now you may ask, what makes tectonic plates move? The answer is in this divergence area, something there is pushing the tectonic plates away. The name of the force responsible is &quot;seafloor spreading&quot;. Unseen by most people and only recently discovered by scientists, it is one of the most important engines of the planet.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The solidification of the magma erupted from the exposed area between tectonic plates continually creates volcanoes and seafloor. As this process continues, new seafloor pushes away old seafloor and the tectonic plates themselves, as seen below.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.mgdkql9slokw" name="h.mgdkql9slokw"></a><span>Converging tectonic plates</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>When tectonic plates converge, either of two things can happen: one climbs over the other or both rise, pushing against each other. As a result, mountain chains form on the convergence zones over million of years.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>A mountain is a tall landform, usually in the form of a peak, set apart from hills both by their height and by being steeper. Though some mountains stand isolated, most are part of mountain ranges. There are three types: volcanic, fold and block.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.pnd6frxrint6" name="h.pnd6frxrint6"></a><span>Volcanic Mountains</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Volcanic mountains are or have been volcanoes, the result of one tectonic plate sliding over another. When this happens, the magma from under the rising plate comes out to the surface and solidifies, which forms the volcano. Now we see the main types of volcanoes.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.qg0r03u2vi5x" name="h.qg0r03u2vi5x"></a><span>Stratovolcanoes</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Where magma eruptions are pre-hardened, they don&rsquo;t spread over a large area, but instead gather in a cone shape, resulting in stratovolcanoes. They can also be called &ldquo;composite volcanoes&rdquo;, as different eruptions pile over each other.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.6qay4h53zxyr" name="h.6qay4h53zxyr"></a><span>Shield volcanoes</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>However, where the magma is more liquid, it tends to be expelled continually for long periods of time and to go further before solidification. The resulting volcano is spread out over hundreds of kilometers and looks like a shield lay flat on the floor.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.3g6o3lne5dme" name="h.3g6o3lne5dme"></a><span>Cinder cone volcanoes</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Other eruption events are more sudden, erupting in an explosion of lava fountains and volcanic ash under pressure from volcanic gas. The material of the resulting volcano is less compact than found on the previous types, mostly loose rocks of solidified lava. They are cone-shaped and often have a dome on the peak.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.vwxusfpcgkia" name="h.vwxusfpcgkia"></a><span>Fold mountains</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>When two tectonic plates collide, the clashing section of the plates rise and become fold mountains. The material of fold mountains is hard rock, since that&rsquo;s what we find under the surface. These mountains are still rising after earthquakes.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.v6m85p3zlf4v" name="h.v6m85p3zlf4v"></a><span>Block mountains</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>It is well known that there are faults between the planet&rsquo;s tectonic plates, but there are faults inside them as well. The bedrock of a tectonic plate is not even, but is instead broken up into fault blocks, some as large as continents. Some fault blocks move vertically in relation to other neighboring fault blocks.

On the map below, you will find all but 2 of the longest mountain ranges, plus the two additions. The two missing are the Mid-Ocean Ridge and the Transantarctic Range. The aim of this chapter is to know where the mountain ranges are, you will find here maps and satellite photographs. On the next chapter we focus on mountains and volcanoes, that&rsquo;s the place for all the pretty pictures.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>I had to draw free-hand the map below myself, so it is quite inexact, but it provides a general view better than anything I could find on the Internet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Some of the maps on the sections below can be confusing, so come back and find them in the world map above. The ideal is to be able to name every red section in the map.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.rdr2cg7hw6me" name="h.rdr2cg7hw6me"></a><span>Mid-Ocean Ridge</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The mid-ocean ridge is the largest mountain chain in the planet, resulting from the seafloor spreading phenomenon mentioned in the previous chapter. It spans the diverging borders of tectonic plates and is made of underwater volcanoes that can reach up to 1km height.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.518byh5j6xzm" name="h.518byh5j6xzm"></a><span>Andes</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Understanding the Andes is essential to understanding South America. It separates a narrow coastal area from the mainland, affecting the climate of most of the continent. The Andes is further broken into many more mountain ranges, or cordilleras, in Spanish. Over the Andes we find large plateaux, wide stretches of high altitude. These are sometimes surrounded by two cordilleras, from the East and from the West. In Spanish, that makes it &quot;Cordillera Occidental&quot; and &quot;Cordillera Oriental&quot;, for Occident and Orient.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Andes pass by seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Per&uacute;, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. Andean plateaux hold three South American capitals: Quito, Ecuador; Bogot&aacute;, Colombia and La Paz, Bol&iacute;via. As a still growing mountain range, The Andes has several active volcanoes.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.ocjnz3cd56od" name="h.ocjnz3cd56od"></a><span>The Rocky Mountains</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Also known as the Rockies, the Rocky Mountains are the second largest mountain range in the world. Currently, National Parks cover much of it. A common delimitation goes from the Liard River, in Canada, to the Rio Grande, in the United States.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>One related notion is that of the &ldquo;American Cordillera&rdquo;. It would include the Rocky Mountains, the Andes, and many other smaller mountain ranges. As an end result, the American Cordillera goes through the entirety of the American Continent, from Alaska to Patagonia. It is evident on the physical world map from the previous chapter.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.itw3fjb2uqq8" name="h.itw3fjb2uqq8"></a><span>Transantarctic Mountains</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Transantarctic Mountains stand between West and East Antarctica. They stretch from the Ross Sea in the south to the Weddell Sea in the north. It is often the only area of Antarctica not covered by ice, due to lack of precipitation. The mountain range is home to the McMurdo Dry Valleys, mentioned in the previous chapter on deserts.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.49scr4e68qnh" name="h.49scr4e68qnh"></a><span>Great Dividing Range</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Great Dividing Range runs through the Eastern Australian Coast. As you may expect from our previous chapters, it has great effect on the Australian climate. The mountain range is a collection of smaller mountain ranges, with both fault block and fold mountains. It is a product of the collision of Australia and what now are South America and New Zealand, some 300 million years ago.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.qp54fe3szoig" name="h.qp54fe3szoig"></a><span>Kunlun Mountains</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Kunlun Mountains stand completely in China and forms the northern border of the Tibetan Plateau.

Look at this:</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Himalayas stand in Asia, between India and China. It is home to 9 of the 10 highest peaks on Earth, including Mount Everest. The melting of its glaciers give rise to three rivers we reviewed before: the Indus, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. The drainage basin of these three rivers house 600 million people today.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>What we see on the illustration above is the Indian Plate clashing against the Eurasian Plate. As they meet some 50 million years ago, the land that was under the sea between them rose, creating the Himalayan fold mountains. For this reason, you may find sea shells on the peak of Mount Everest today.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.pxdixims7smu" name="h.pxdixims7smu"></a><span>Altai Mountains</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Altai Mountains cover the region where Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and China meet, then continue to shape part of the Mongolian western border with China.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.o0mbbkayvkrt" name="h.o0mbbkayvkrt"></a><span>Carpathian Mountains</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The Carpathians form an arc across Central and Eastern Europe.

However, a list of peaks by height is boring. Since the Himalayas are so high compared to all other mountain chains, you have to go a long way down to find a mountain from any other region. There are other ways to measure height, some more meaningful and interesting for us.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>There are many ways to measure mountains, more than a dozen. There&#39;s &quot;isolation measure&quot;, &quot;drop measure&quot; and &quot;spire measure&quot;, for example. We will follow for the most part &quot;topographic prominence&quot;, which itself has many variances. There&#39;s &quot;submarine prominence&quot;, &quot;inverse prominence&quot;, &quot;dominance&quot; and &quot;proportional prominence&quot;, for example.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Each of these have different results. In &quot;The Finest Peaks: Prominence and other Mountain Measures&quot;, for example, Adam Helman describes &quot;spire measure&quot;: &ldquo;attempts to quantify the sense of impressiveness afforded a mountain due to great angularity&rdquo;. If this seems interesting, there&#39;s a list of the top peaks according to the reduced spire measure in the related section.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>So let&rsquo;s take a moment to understand better the concept of topographic prominence. To start, please take a moment to understand the following image. The vertical lines show the prominence of the peaks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Topographic prominence is often defined as &ldquo;the height of a mountain above the saddle of the highest ridge connecting it to a peak higher still&rdquo;. You may understand prominence as a measure of the independence of a mountain. The largest mountain in an area will score high, &quot;taking the credit&quot; for the whole region. But neighboring peaks will score lower, since they depend on the elevated area for their high elevation. As a result, a list of mountains by prominence correlates better with their cultural presence: they stand out the most.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>That&rsquo;s enough about this. Now we review a few interesting lists according to different measures, then move on to the mountains by prominence. After that, we will review mountains and volcanoes that are relevant for other reasons.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.ljeaea9mngnh" name="h.ljeaea9mngnh"></a><span>Highest unclimbed mountains</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>A mountain is considered climbed only when someone reaches the peak and comes back alive. Therefore, only half the climb is done upon reaching the peak.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The first successful climb of Mount Everest was completed in 1953.

In addition to being a nice round cut-off number, the figure is also relevant to climbers.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The human body works best at sea-level. At an altitude of 2,100 m, we see the first signs of the effect of decreased atmospheric pressure on human blood. As you climb higher, pressure decreases exponentially, while temperature, only linearly. At the same time, montane climate itself becomes more extreme with height, due to the disturbing presence of the mountain itself. At 8,000 M high, the presence of oxygen in the air drops to one third of normal levels. Without supplementary oxygen, this causes a person to die in a few minutes.

The hazards in the venture come from altitude sickness, difficult weather or avalanches. One specially dangerous spot is an icefall of the Khumbu glacier, from which large blocks of ice fall periodically. Many climbers have died trying to cross it. Tenzing Norgay, from Nepal, and Edmund Hillary, from New Zealand, were the first confirmed to climb it, in 1953.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.jb6gvvjtybsf" name="h.jb6gvvjtybsf"></a><span>Aconcagua</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Aconcagua, in southern Andes, is the highest mountain outside of Asia&mdash;this same isolation grants it the second highest spot by prominence.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.2e5fatby8s1o" name="h.2e5fatby8s1o"></a><span>Mount McKinley (Denali)</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Mount McKinley, in Alaska, is the tallest mountain in North America.

On Central America, we see Pico de Orizaba in Mexico and Volc&aacute;n Tajumulco in Guatemala. All the way south, in Antarctica, we have Vinson Massif. Now for the Andes, let&#39;s go South to North. In Argentina there&#39;s Aconcagua. Further north, Chimborazo in Ecuador. Then, in northern Andes, we have Pico Crist&oacute;val Colon in Colombia and, a little bit to the East, Pico Bol&iacute;var, in Venezuela. Then all the way north in Europe, we see Mont Blanc, in the border between France and Italy. Going towards Asia, in the Caucasus, we see Mount Elbrus. In nearby Iran, south of the Caspian Sea, there&#39;s Mount Damavand. Stopping by in Africa, there&#39;s Ras Dashen in the Ethiopian Highlands and Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, the largest free-standing mountain, as we have seen.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Now let&#39;s go all the way to the extreme East of Russia, where we see Klyuchevskaya Sopka, the one on that gorgeous photograph blazing in the night under the Milky Way.

In general, a cave would be an area under the surface that is large enough for parts of it not to receive sunlight. Some are openings into rock, others are large areas under the ground big enough for a person to explore. Let&#39;s go through the types and see a few examples of each.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.j6mvyfna4111" name="h.j6mvyfna4111"></a><span>Cave Types</span></h2><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.r9x00hfn1us9" name="h.r9x00hfn1us9"></a><span>Shallow Caves</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Let&#39;s start with a few types of small and shallow caves.</span></p><h4 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.412h3vgazti7" name="h.412h3vgazti7"></a><span>Rock Shelters</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Rock shelters are useful as protection against the weather.

A few soluble rock types are: limestone (most common), chalk, dolomite, marble, salt and gypsum. As a result of the water seeping in from above, these caves feature speleothems, special formations of rock. The image below shows the most common speleothems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The most famous are stalactites (on the ceiling) and stalagmites (on the floor). When connected, these form a column. The image below shows many more types of speleothems.

Climate refers to long term patterns, while weather is the climate condition in a short period&mdash;a day, for example.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The single most important factor to the climate is the Sun and how it doesn&rsquo;t shine in the entire planet the same way. In the image below, you see that the Earth is tilted as it circles around the Sun. However it does also spin. As a result, there is a large region near the Equator that faces straight at the Sun. The regions far from the Equator face the Sun from an angle, so they get less sunlight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The following image shows the intertropical convergence zone between the tropics: Cancer and Capricorn. From the tropics to the arctic and antarctic circles, we have the temperate zones. From the arctic and antarctic circles to the poles, we see the frigid zones. Insulation is different for each of these zones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Earth does not rotate around the Sun in a circle, but in an ellipses. Because of this, the Sun is closer in some parts of the year than in others. In the temperate zone, where sunlight is already lower, that is enough to cause the seasons. Around the Equator, always facing squarely at the Sun, the difference isn&rsquo;t as great and there are no seasons. However, since the global climate is one entire system, it also faces changes: a rainy season and a dry season.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.t1xqj85omnki" name="h.t1xqj85omnki"></a><span>The atmosphere</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>On the image below, you will see the layers of the atmosphere. Only the troposphere and the stratosphere are of concern to us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Most human activity, except for high-altitude aviation and spaceflight, happens in the troposphere. The stratosphere is relevant to us for two reasons: it is home to the jet stream and to the ozone layer.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.jtqel030682w" name="h.jtqel030682w"></a><span>Composition</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere consists roughly of:</span></p><ul class="c1 lst-kix_u1lnnqck54sz-0 start"><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>78% nitrogen;</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>21% oxygen;</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>1% other gases.</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span>Both Nitrogen and Oxygen are abundant because they are heavy enough not to escape the atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions expelled the nitrogen gas and living organisms created the oxygen, over billions of years through photosynthesis. The 1% of other gases includes ozone, carbon dioxide, water and others. Both ozone and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases, they help keep heat from the Sun in the planet surface. Without the greenhouse effect Earth would freeze, being unable to hold heat generated by the Sun. With a stronger greenhouse effect, the planet would become warmer. Photosynthesis, the origin of all the oxygen, uses carbon dioxide. In turn, it protects the same living organisms from genetic damage by ultraviolet from the Sun.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.oappp3xvz65" name="h.oappp3xvz65"></a><span>Atmospheric circulation</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Alright, so it&rsquo;s warmer in the Equator, it&rsquo;s a little colder in the tropics and much colder in the poles. All that differently-heated air doesn&rsquo;t just stay where it is. This is the most important knowledge you have to take out of this chapter. Everything that happens next in the climate follows from this difference in temperature: the result is &quot;atmospheric circulation&quot;.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Atmospheric circulation is the movement of air throughout the atmosphere of the planet. It follows from the second law of thermodynamics, as the different sections of the planet exchange heat. Without the input of more heat from the Sun, this would result in entropy: the entire atmosphere would end with the same temperature. However, because the Sun heats the Equator more than the tropics and the poles every day, the process never stops.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Moving air is how atmospheric heat gets exchanged around: that&#39;s wind. The warm winds of the Equator blow to the tropics. The medium-warm winds of the temperate zone blow to the Equator and to the poles. The cold winds of the poles blow to the tropics or in a spiral around the poles, trapped. The result is what you see below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>So, we have one &ldquo;cell&rdquo; for each of the zones mentioned before. The Hadley Cell around the Equator, the Ferrel Cell between the tropics and the poles and the Polar Cell in the poles. On the image, the blue arrows are cold winds, the red arrows are warm winds.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Before we go into more detail, please notice the directions of surface wind. Around the Equator, surface wind blows West and toward the Equator. In the Ferrel Cell, surface wind blows East and toward the poles. In the poles, surface wind blows West and toward the tropics. The words in yellow are the names of each of those winds: trade winds, westerlies and polar easterlies. However, in reality winds don&rsquo;t follow exactly that pattern because they function differently over land and sea. We will see a &ldquo;real&rdquo; wind map further below.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>You may notice that as well as moving across the planet, winds also move vertically. This happens because cold air is heavier than hot air. As the hot air moves upward, however, it also cools down, becoming cold air. It then moves downward, as hot air takes its place. The Hadley Cell is so tall because warm winds meet in the Equator and there&rsquo;s only one way from there: up.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>There is one other wind movement we can observe. We have accounted for vertical movement and for movement across the planet. The latter doesn&rsquo;t happen in a straight line though, and we haven&rsquo;t accounted for that. The cold winds in the Hadley Cell move from east to west due to the Coriolis effect. As the Earth spins around its axis east to west, it drags the atmosphere, but not as much as the land. So a wind moving north while the Earth spins, when plotted on a stationary map, will seem to curve. Read that again, take a look at the map, look at the image below and try to wrap your mind around it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Now that we have understood what traces the path of winds, let&rsquo;s go through each of the three cells.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.p3q252lfuha" name="h.p3q252lfuha"></a><span>The Hadley Cell</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Please take a moment to observe the Hadley Cell in the image from before.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>As the sun heats the surface near the Equator, the air becomes hotter and rises, carrying humidity. It is then replaced by cold and dry air from the higher troposphere, which proceeds to warm up and gain humidity near the surface. Meanwhile, the hot and humid air forms rain clouds and, with altitude, becomes colder and rains down, losing humidity and mass. The now lost water in the air stored most of the heat, so the air becomes cold and dry again, so it falls back down to the surface. The end result is clear: heavy rainfall in the intertropical convergence zone, which the Hadley Cell covers. The word &ldquo;Convergence&rdquo; comes from the northeast and the southeast trade winds coming together.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.8e83zq34102z" name="h.8e83zq34102z"></a><span>The Polar Cell</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Now let&rsquo;s compare that to what happens in the poles. Because there isn&rsquo;t as much heat from the Sun in the poles, the air is cold and dry. However, the air at the Arctic and Antarctic circles is still warmer than the air right on the poles, since it is in constant exchange with the warmer winds of the Ferrel Cell. This difference of temperature causes this warmer air to go toward the pole, where it rapidly cools off again. As a result, the poles function as a heat sink: whatever heated and humid air comes in contact with it, becomes cold and dry. Because it is so cold in the poles, the humidity does not fall as rain, but as snow. This sets the stage for the polar deserts we mentioned in the biomes chapter.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.jeujep2pcpxy" name="h.jeujep2pcpxy"></a><span>The Ferrel Cell</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Now we circle back to analyze the Ferrel Cell, between the tropics and the arctic and antarctic circles. The Ferrel Cell receives both cold and dry air from the poles and warm and humid air from the intertropical convergence zone. The question is, which wins, that is, which is stronger? The answer is, it depends on the time of the year. When the Earth is closer to the Sun&mdash;during Summer&mdash;the warm winds of the Equator dominate. But when the Earth is further away from the Sun&mdash;during Winter&mdash; the cold winds of the poles expand and escape.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In the Ferrel Cell region, we find the westerlies winds.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.yjjx15o1nzhp" name="h.yjjx15o1nzhp"></a><span>Winds</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Due to interactions between land and sea, the winds do not follow the general path outlined in the previous map. Below is the &ldquo;real&rdquo; wind map I mentioned before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>In blue, you have the westerlies. In yellow, the northeasterly trade winds. In orange, the southeasterly trade winds. The regions marked with the green and pink numbers are low-pressure areas. We will explain more about those later.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>To understand the addition of land into this process, this is the most important fact: land warms faster than water, but also cools faster. As a result, in the warmer months land area will be warmer than the ocean. However, in the cold months the ocean keeps the heat it gets for longer, while land loses it faster. As a result, the ocean will be warmer than the land.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.oi7zpl43anbx" name="h.oi7zpl43anbx"></a><span>Northeast and Southeast trade winds</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The northeast and southeast trade winds are cold surface winds moving from the Poles to the Equator. Both flow east to west due to the Coriolis Effect.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Northeast trade winds allowed European expansion into the Americas. In a similar way, they carry hurricanes to the Caribbean and North America and cyclones to Asia.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.5ebgbtzjgmp" name="h.5ebgbtzjgmp"></a><span>Westerlies</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Westerlies, or anti-trades, blow in the opposite direction of the trade winds. During winter, when the polar winds are strongest, the Westerlies also increase in strength.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.13gjvgbsojn" name="h.13gjvgbsojn"></a><span>The Coriolis Effect</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Now why do the Westerlies flow East, while the trade winds flow West? As we have seen before, without the Coriolis Effect winds would blow in a straight line, either North or South. Here&rsquo;s the difference: the trade winds are escaping from the Equator, blowing to the poles. However, the Westerlies are escaping from the poles, blowing toward the Equator. Considering this, here is how it works due to the coriolis effect:</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><ul class="c1 lst-kix_56hty7wev1r3-0 start"><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>Northern Hemisphere:</span></li></ul><ul class="c1 lst-kix_56hty7wev1r3-1 start"><li class="c0 c9 c21"><span>Moving </span><span class="c12">north to south</span><span>: winds </span><span class="c12">turn west</span><span>&nbsp;(northern hemisphere trade winds);</span></li><li class="c0 c21 c9"><span>Moving </span><span class="c12">south to north</span><span>: winds </span><span class="c12">turn east</span><span>&nbsp;(northern hemisphere westerlies);</span></li></ul><ul class="c1 lst-kix_56hty7wev1r3-0"><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>Southern Hemisphere:</span></li></ul><ul class="c1 lst-kix_56hty7wev1r3-1 start"><li class="c0 c21 c9"><span>Moving </span><span class="c12">north to south</span><span>: winds </span><span class="c12">turn east</span><span>&nbsp;(southern hemisphere westerlies);</span></li><li class="c0 c21 c9"><span>Moving </span><span class="c12">south to north</span><span>: winds </span><span class="c12">turn west</span><span>&nbsp;(southern hemisphere trade winds);</span></li></ul><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.zfxhdu48b7t7" name="h.zfxhdu48b7t7"></a><span>Monsoon</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Monsoon winds affects the region surrounding the Indian Ocean: West Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia. You may remember Monsoon Forests were one kind of biome we studied before. That biome shows one dry season and one wet season, when under the effect of monsoon rains, which the monsoon winds cause.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The different heating rates between land and water come into play to explain the monsoons. During summer, the Indian Ocean is colder than the land surrounding it. As a result, the air over land rises and is replaced by cool and wet air from the ocean. Upon reaching land, however, these winds are forced upward, which cools them further, releasing the humidity as rain. Those are the monsoon rains. This colder air then returns to the ocean, since it tends downward, like a waterfall from high land to low ocean.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>This whole process happens in a similar manner to generate coastal winds all over the world, but it is more intense in the monsoon region. Slight differences happen throughout Asia, but this explanation is detailed enough for our purposes.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.h49yozh4w9hn" name="h.h49yozh4w9hn"></a><span>Jet stream</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>For all the talk about the interaction between land and water and its effect on winds patterns, there is one type that is not affected. Jet streams are so high up, between the troposphere and the stratosphere, that land and sea cover does not factor into its functioning.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jet streams are fast and narrow air currents. They flow roughly between the three cells of atmospheric circulation: along the tropics and along the arctic and antarctic circles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Their practical importance lies in shortening travel times for airplanes that fly high enough to meet them. They are important for the climate because they steer storms. For example, in both 2007 and 2012 intense storms hit Britain due to changes in the polar jet stream in the Northern Hemisphere.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.nb5yzsag4b5o" name="h.nb5yzsag4b5o"></a><span>Atmospheric Pressure</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted on everything on the surface by the weight of the Atmosphere. It is not easily apparent, but if you close an empty bottle on a mountain top, where the Atmosphere around you is rare and light, and then bring the bottle to the ocean level, the heavier atmosphere there will crush that bottle.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Other than mountaintops, we also find low atmospheric pressure on deserts. That&rsquo;s because the air warm and moving upward, so it doesn&rsquo;t exert much force downward.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>High pressure areas are more important to us. Think back at the three atmospheric circulation cells, and how other than surface winds, they also had winds in the upper troposphere. Wherever you have cold winds coming down from two different atmospheric circulation cells in a same area, the pressure will be higher than in other places. In the same way, wherever you have warm wind going upward from two bordering cells, you have low pressure. Please take a look at the atmospheric circulation map with the green planet and find the blue H&rsquo;s and the red L&rsquo;s. Those are high and low atmospheric pressure regions.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>So, what happens there? First of all, in low-pressure areas the winds are stronger, since warm air, because it is lighter, moves faster than cold air. It also rains, since the hot air moving upward carries humidity, which then rains down as the air cools.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Meanwhile, in high-pressure areas you have clear skies, as the air is dry. The lack of cloud cover also exposes the land to direct sunlight, but since there are no clouds to accumulate the heat, temperatures are lower.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>All would be fine if it were not for the Coriolis Effect. Again, because the Earth is spinning, all this motion tends to happen in a circular pattern. This is the result:</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Winds are stronger where the temperature difference that causes them to exist is larger. In low-atmospheric pressure areas, this difference can be very large and be created very fast because all that rising, wet and warm air cools off fast. As long as there&rsquo;s warm water to keep the process going, it doesn&rsquo;t stop. That&rsquo;s why hurricanes damage coastal cities, but doesn&rsquo;t go much farther. Once the hurricane is over land, it lacks fuel&mdash;the warm and wet winds&mdash;to keep it going.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.json24t17wrz" name="h.json24t17wrz"></a><span>Ocean circulation</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>So all that happens in the atmosphere, but what about the oceans? After all, ocean heat is also uneven based on distance to the Equator. In a similar way to Atmospheric Circulation, we have Ocean Circulation, resulting in the Thermohaline circulation, or the &ldquo;global conveyor belt&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>They are important for the weather in many ways, but especially because warm currents help warm up surface winds.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.6h535s98y2m" name="h.6h535s98y2m"></a><span>Global Conveyor Belt</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>As a result of Ocean circulation, ocean currents follow the dynamics pictured below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Again, the red and blue lines mean warm and cold currents, this time with a twist. Because only the surface of water heats up, deep currents are cold, while surface currents are warm. You can see two areas near the poles labeled &ldquo;deep water formation&rdquo;, where surface currents cool off and move deeper underwater. You may also notice that in two areas the cold currents warm up and rise to the surface: the eastern coast of Africa and the Pacific Ocean.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Possibly the most striking feature of the image is the circle around Antarctica, with warm currents on the outside and cold currents on the inside. That&rsquo;s the Antarctic Circumpolar current, part of the previously mentioned perpetual storm raging around Antarctica.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Something you might not notice at a glance is that, on the Northern Hemisphere, currents run clockwise while, on the Southern Hemisphere, they flow counter-clockwise. Just as before, that&rsquo;s a result of the Coriolis Effect.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Knowledge of ocean currents was essential up to the steam-era and is still important to lower transoceanic travel costs.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Below you will find a world map of the main ocean currents. Put together with the global conveyor belt map, we will now examine the system by breaking it down into parts.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.va5ncsvh406t" name="h.va5ncsvh406t"></a><span>Gulf Stream</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>In the global conveyor map, take a moment to find the warm current going from Antarctica through the Atlantic Ocean to the North Pole. In the ocean currents world map, you will see it has been broken up into the following currents:</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><ul class="c1 lst-kix_zibffkiomk8s-0 start"><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>Benguela;</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>South Equatorial;</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>North Equatorial;</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>Caribbean;</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>Loop;</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>Gulf Stream;</span></li><li class="c0 c8 c9"><span>North Atlantic;</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span>Of these, the Gulf Stream is of special importance. It warms up the eastern coast of North America and the western coast of Europe by carrying warm currents from the Equator.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Europeans have known about it since the 16th century, and Spanish ships used it to travel from the Caribbean back to the homeland. In the 18th century, it was further studied by the American Benjamin Franklin, leading to significant gains in travel.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The current shape of the Gulf Stream&mdash;and thus of the entire global conveyor belt&mdash;developed from the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, 12 to 15 million years ago. Before then, ocean currents would flow from the Atlantic to the Pacific and both Eastern North America and Western Europe were colder. This makes the creation of the Isthmus of Panama one of the most important geological events on Earth.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.t6ju3j8vu9qf" name="h.t6ju3j8vu9qf"></a><span>Humboldt Current</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Humboldt Current is named Peru/Chile in the ocean currents world map. It consists of cold currents from the South Pole, flowing north along the south american west coast. As a result, it makes Chile and the Peruvian coast colder. The Humboldt Current is home to one of the richest marine life ecosystems in the world.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.jncugbvupted" name="h.jncugbvupted"></a><span>Agulhas Current</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Agulhas Current, seen above, delayed Portuguese exploration of the Indian Ocean.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.g2jd85n6x4so" name="h.g2jd85n6x4so"></a><span>The end-result</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Below you will find a climate world map based on the K&ouml;ppen climate classifications. It somewhat correlates with the biomes world map we have seen before, but let&rsquo;s examine it from the perspective of the climate.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.m6m0hoyrhwhd" name="h.m6m0hoyrhwhd"></a><span>Ice cap, highlands, non-permanent ice, tundra and the subarctic</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>In Greenland and Antarctica, we have &ldquo;Ice cap&rdquo;, meaning that those areas are permanently covered in ice. There&rsquo;s an important distinction to be made here. &ldquo;Ice sheets&rdquo; or &ldquo;continental glaciers&rdquo; are ice covers with an area greater than 50,000Km2. There are two of them in the planet: on Greenland and on Antarctica. We call &ldquo;ice caps&rdquo; anything smaller, from mountaintop glaciers to the frozen Arctic. The ice cap climate region, which is not the same as an ice cap in general, covers both ice caps and ice sheets.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>This is confusing because we find ice caps on the &ldquo;highlands&rdquo; climate region. These are some of the tallest mountain chains we studied before, you should be able to identify them.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In addition to this, and keeping with the &quot;ice&quot; theme, we have the non-permanent ice areas. This is a sort of alternate to the &quot;ice cap&quot; classification.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The subarctic and tundra regions are cold due to proximity to the Arctic. As we have seen, they are covered by the tundra and taiga biomes.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.anovvo6p4sz" name="h.anovvo6p4sz"></a><span>Humid continental and Humid subtropical</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Humid continental areas feature the classic four seasons system, shielded from a greater influence of rain-carrying winds by their inner placing.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In contrast, Humid subtropical areas are typically on eastern coasts, receiving rainfall from westerlies winds.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.6ejuw7mg0vez" name="h.6ejuw7mg0vez"></a><span>Marine west coast and Mediterranean</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Ever heard that in London or Seattle it rains a lot? That&rsquo;s the marine west coast climate, constantly affected by rain-carrying westerlies winds (which, you must remember, travel east to west). These are the same rains affected by rainshadow, and you can see the resulting deserts in the map.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Mediterranean climate, just like the biome, shows hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c4"><a id="h.7wu43rbpbl1a" name="h.7wu43rbpbl1a"></a><span>Arid and Semiarid</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>We are well familiarized with this condition from the biomes chapter.
