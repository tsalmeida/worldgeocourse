<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Before I started writing this course, I thought I knew enough about the planet. Enough to talk to people and say interesting things, enough to act smart. I guess as I grew older, got married and had kids, these things lost their importance and suddenly I didn't believe I knew enough anymore.</p>

<p>My goal was then to learn the important stuff, things that you only learn if you seek them, or if you spend your life traveling the world. Traveling everywhere is expensive, troublesome, and in general not practical for most people.</p>

<p>Though I am a Geography graduate, I have many times considered that option to have been a mistake. Since my first day in College, when I first regretted it, I have had a few occasions to change my mind, this course being the most recent. My bad impression of the science, however, is also a big part of why I'm doing this at all. I learned almost none of this in College. When I looked online for something like this, I found nothing acceptable, and it doesn't surprise me, I wouldn't expect much from geographers.  I believe people want to know more about the planet, and geographers are doing a bad job at helping them.</p>

<p>I understand the Geography we will engage here as part of a Liberal Arts Education, that is, education worthy of and necessary for every free person. Every free man should know these things, so here we are to learn them.</p>

<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>You can click on most images to enlarge them without leaving the website and the same goes for youtube videos. External links, when clicked, will open on a new tab.</p>

<p>You will navigate through the courses by clicking on the vertical bars on either side of the central section. They are not viewable at this moment because there are no previous or next pages to the Introduction.</p>

<h1>Something else</h1>

<p>I designed this website using HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript (jQuery). I hope to keep it going for many years, no matter how successful it may be.</p>

<p>At the moment it doesn't cost me much to maintain, so I have no interest in any sort of payment, nor in using ads of any kind. This might change in the future if it becomes popular and the bandwidth costs go up. I don't like ads and will resort to donations if possible.</p>

<p>You will find our forum on the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldgeographycourse">/r/WorldGeographyCourse</a> subreddit.</p>
